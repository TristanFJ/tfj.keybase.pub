    I regard books as akin to time travel. An author spends their entire life forming a unique perspective and then distilling this perspective into the books they create. These books preserve their life's knowledge through time, where this knowledge can inform the new perspectives of younger generations. When I finish a book, I want it to stay with me in mind and heart as it shaped a piece of my being. These reviews allow me to easily recall when I finished a book and my brief opinion of it.

<summary><h1>65: Bogleheads' Guide to Investing - Taylor Larimore, Michael LeBoeuf, Mel Lindauer</h1></summary>
<p>1-4-21</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/381355.The_Bogleheads_Guide_to_Investing?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=pOp5IpBLVP&rank=2" class="booklink"><img src="images/65.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This was a helpful primer for developing healthy investing habits. They start from the bottom, assuming the reader needs help along the entire way. This led to me skimming through some parts but most of it was insightful. I can say that reading this had a direct impact on my investing practices. While finance can be an overwhelming subject, with taxes and insurance forming their own respective armies of complexity, this book is a solid introduction to the path of fiscal responsibility. It's not the only book you'll need, but they include references to other works that might be of value. I will most likely read more from the Bogleheads in the future.

<summary><h1>66: The Way of Kings - Brandon Sanderson</h1></summary>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=neBXnjcyjW&rank=1" class="booklink"><img src="images/66.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This is a sizeable book, and although I'm not often a fiction reader this was a captivating read. Being the first in the series it definitely serves as an introduction to the larger setting at play, but it doesn't fail to excite and inspire questions. There's a decent amount of action scenes, which I'm not usually a huge fan of, but they aren't drawn out or over-dramatic. The action is always for a cause, it's never mindless bloodshed or just trying to fill pages.
    <br><br>
    The heart of this book for me was the world building. I won't spoil anything, but there's a solid amount of diverse creatures, mystery, metaphysics, intricate economics as well as some history that is slowly revealed. It's a very interesting setting that Sanderson has developed, and in the words of my friend, it's not just world building but universe building. I believe Sanderson refers to his universe as the Cosmere.
    <br><br>
    What first struck me about Sanderson's writing is the dialogue. Conversations are something that is easy to do but hard to master, and if Sanderson hasn't mastered it then he's at least very close to mastery. I love the characters and I'm very excited to see how they grow as the story progresses.

<h2>
    This is a rather short collection, and there are a few noticeable typos, but the parables don't need to be long or perfectly translated to still be meaningful. Not all of them were easily understood, but I thought most of them were a beautiful representation of that which cannot easily be named or described with words. I've been a longtime fan of Koans and eastern wisdom so some of the stories I have heard before but they were appreciated nonetheless. There are pictures included with some of the stories, and I didn't feel they were very necessary but at times they were a nice touch.

<h2>
    I'm totally loving this series. It really does feel like it hasn't even built up to the climax, but it has been very entertaining all the same. The story contains normalized things like sword battles, magic sects and the like, but they all have their own original twist that makes it very compelling and gives the world a rich texture. The characters remain extremely interesting and it's hard for me to choose a favorite, I don't think I could if you demanded it. I am reading other books alongside this series, however it seems like this has taken up the majority of my reading time. I immediately bought the next in the series and I am dearly excited to see how the plot develops.

<h2>
    This was a major culmination in the Stormlight Archives. It's hard for me to censor myself, as I want to talk about the juicy details but I know I wouldn't be doing this series justice. We are starting to understand so much more of the background, what's at stake, who the major players are in this fight for Roshar. I love it. Not only for the philosophy and the underlying message, but for the comedy, the suspense, the surprising action scenes, and the top tier dialogue.

<h2>
    This addition in the series highlights just how much things are beginning to ramp up. New players are introduced, new mysteries of epic proportion, and some other background details are filled in to really satisfy some of the questions we've been asking. And of course, the new answers leave many new questions as well. It was a much shorter read than the other Stormlight books I've enjoyed, but I thought it was a fitting size. Sanderson does a very good job at laying the foundation for the story and then slowly developing on what is a very satisfying world to explore. Reading this series has been a pleasant break from some of the hard sci-fi that I had been consumed by.

<summary><h1>71: The Behavioral Investor - Daniel Crosby</h1></summary>
<p>5-19-21</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36960014-the-behavioral-investor?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=gG27sjTT78&rank=1" class="booklink"><img src="images/71.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This book, being the conjunction of finance and psychology, was a very interesting read. Lucky for me, you don't need to be an expert in either to appreciate this book, as the author succinctly incudes the important aspects of both topics without being weighted down by unnecessary conclusions. He applies psychological studies that at first appear purely academic but in fact are intimately related to how humans interact with the financial environment we have created.
    <br><br>
    Some concepts were familiar to me, but seeing them through the eyes of a trained psychologist has molded my perspective to allow a deeper understanding of why these concepts are perpetuated in the first place. And while obviously not a panacea to "becoming a successful investor", it has definitely given me insight into my own behavior and how that translates to my investing habits. We are organisms fine tuned for hunting-gathering, and these instincts can run opposite to the healthy habits necessary for investing.
    <br><br>
    I'm not sure that I'll re-read this in the future, but Crosby includes many intriguing references in this book that I may turn to next, and I imagine that I will be reading more of his works.

<summary><h1>72: The Two Hands of God - Alan Watts</h1></summary>
<p>6-1-21</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60568.The_Two_Hands_of_God" class="booklink"><img src="images/72.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    Another wonderful read by Alan Watts, this is a nice mix of quotes, his commentary, as well as his original elaboration on what the appearance of duality means and the many ways we can relate to this (non)duality. As always his commentary is very satisfying, Watts presents these ideas in a way that is both fascinatingly clear and consistently entertaining. Some of the excerpts he included in the book were confusing at times, such as the quotes from Hindu or Buddhist texts, but he goes on to explain the significance found in each passage.
    <br><br>
    Most of my exposure to Alan Watts has been through his recorded audio lectures, which are fantastic in their own right, but it's very rewarding to read more of his written texts. He's definitely one of my favorite historical figures, as he is able to talk eloquently about something that is typically considered mystical and esoteric all without creating the impression that this is something hidden and secluded away from the "everyday experience". I do believe the focus of his works are some of the most important lessons we can learn in life, and even though he doesn't have a monopoly on expressing these lessons he does so in a very unique and irreplaceable fashion.

<h2>
    Absolutely beautiful. Even with its impressive wordcount I read through this series very quickly, and that alone could stand as the testament to my enjoyment. I was introduced to this series during a time where sci-fi was my main focus, and sci-fi definitely holds a special place in my heart, but even still this fantasy series satisfied most if not all of my cravings with fiction. The escalation in this edition was fantastic and incredibly epic. There are so many larger things happening in the Cosmere, clearly, but we have seen a lot happen on Roshar. 
    <br><br>
    The characters in this series are still some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, partly due to the lovely dialogue, and partly due to the intricate world that's been revealed. I very much look forward to the next edition of The Stormlight Archives, whenever that is finished in due time. I'm tempted to start reading some of his other works, especially the ones that take place in the same Cosmere universe, but I should probably finish some of the other books I've neglected before doing so. I will conclude by saying "Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."

<h2>
    This was good, not great. The setting is interesting as it focuses on the ability to interact with reality from higher dimensions, and the story focuses on the danger that this increasing power leads to. It was hard to form close relationships with the characters as they're not given a ton of detail, the writing is quick and direct, but not terrible. Some of the character development felt rushed, but it's a short book trying to cover a large timeframe so that's no surprise. There were some twists but nothing mindbending. There were definitely some good nuggets in this, but I don't feel greatly compelled to read more Exurb1a anytime soon.

<a href="https://www.gregegan.net/DIASPORA/DIASPORA.html" class="booklink"> <img src=images/75.jpg width=75 title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    Greg Egan consistently delivers high quality science fiction, especially if you're looking for something steeped in detailed concepts and exotic possibilities. This work brings alien life to the furthest edges of spacetime, and the exploration of such life is very compelling and mysterious. The motivations are plain; the universe is unstable and life desires to exist, but ultimately no bounds can be placed on the lifeform that chooses to find a way over the coming obstacle. At this point I've read a decent amount of Greg Egan, and I love his hard sci-fi talents, but I think I need to see if there are other authors creating in a similar style. Even still, I will most likely return to reading Egan.

<h2>
    Going into this I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I have enjoyed Liu's <a href="#three-body">previous writing</a> and had high hopes for this, and honestly I was a bit disappointed, but I think that's only because I was so impressed by his more elaborate sci-fi works. I'm not saying it's at all bad, I think the story's creativity is very rewarding and the plot structure is believable and entertaining. The size of this story is small, but it was a fitting length for what needed to be said. If you go into this expecting a lighthearted but fun read instead of something that will be intricately detailed and pushing the edges of thought then I believe most would find it an enjoyable journey.

<h2>
    I don't think this is a book I could compare with others, it has a unique flavor all of its own. The combination of the time period and the author's perspective of the story's characters creates a very interesting sense of coming across a miracle in nature all while preserving an air of mystery around that miracle. I very much enjoyed slowly understanding Larry more and more. The other characters were at best a background to contrast with Larry's journey. We don't see much of Larry's journey because of his own independent temperament, but even still Somerset creates a very detailed report of how he interprets Larry's inner life. My enjoyment of the story largely stemmed from the fact that I could very much relate to Larry's quest and quirks. I don't think I will reread this, but it does leave me wondering if there exists any of Larry's creations out there somewhere.

<summary><h1>78: Cryptonomicon - Neal Stephenson</h1></summary>
<p>8-1-21</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816.Cryptonomicon" class="booklink"> <img src=images/78.jpg width=75 title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    Cryptonomicon is one of those special works that actively influenced my daily thinking. It's a vast collection of topics that seamlessly build on each other, and even with its hefty size I still wanted more in the end. I think my first encounter with Stephenson's work was 'Snow Crash', which I read before I started reviewing books. Snow Crash was enjoyable, I remember it featuring very creative sci-fi concepts, but Cryptonomicon felt much more rooted in our familiar reality while still retaining that incredibly creative sci-fi streak.
    <br><br>
    Stephenson's writing is comedic yet serious. I would call it witty, it's very entertaining and yet doesn't distract from the story at hand. He has some of the best metaphors I've ever read, they're entirely descriptive and unique. There were several times I just had to stop and laugh at the way he describes things, a laugh that was in awe and respect instead of a mocking laugh.
    <br><br>
    If you have any interest in computing or data privacy then I highly recommend Cryptonomicon.
