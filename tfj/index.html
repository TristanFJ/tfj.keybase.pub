    <div><h1>Information is power.</h1>
        <h2>Knowledge changes perspectives, and these perspectives open up possibilities that were previously unknown and inaccessible. How do you wield your attention? What are you creating with your time? The future is waiting to be made.</h2></div>
    <div><h1>Discovery and exploration.</h1>
        <h2>The power of experimentation resides in the uncertainty. The result of an experiment is only valuable to you because it's unknown. The revolutionary inventors could not predict their inventions beforehand. These inventions were the result of following their curiosity, of exploring their own unique perspective without any specific end-result in mind. New ideas are never pandering to the common public. New ideas bend boundaries that the public is afraid to approach. We are all capable of new ideas, ideas that can change Humanity and our selves for the better.</h2></div>
    <div><h1>About this website.</h1>
        <h2>This personal website doesn't contain very much but I am consistently adding to it for a few reasons: I am interested in learning the process of web development for the freedom it gives me in the representation of my own digital content. <a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> is a service that I have found to be a leader in identity and cryptographic management, I'm not in love with them but I've yet to find a replacement. This allows me a relatively durable medium in which to bridge the gap between disparate content, such as my various social media and writings.</h2></div>
