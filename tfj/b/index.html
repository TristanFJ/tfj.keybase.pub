<h2>
    I regard books as akin to time travel. An author spends their entire life forming a unique perspective and then distilling this perspective into the books they create. These books preserve their life's knowledge through time, where this knowledge can inform the new perspectives of younger generations. When I finish a book, I want it to stay with me in mind and heart as it shaped a piece of my being. These reviews allow me to easily recall when I finished a book and my brief opinion of it.

<div><h1>1: Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari</h1>
<p>1-09-19</p>
<a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/" class="booklink"><img src="images/1.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This was one of the most "historical" books I have read in a while. It starts off from the very beginning of mankind, and attempts to work its way up from pre-history all the way into the coming modern ages. Although the future (and many modern innovations) aren't entirely covered, I felt it did a good job at connecting the important historical dots. I recommend this read if you want a refresher on your species' history.

<div><h1>2: Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Robert M. Pirsig</h1>
<p>1-16-19</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance" class="booklink"><img src="images/2.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    What a book. I finished reading it five minutes ago, so I'm still reeling. Trying to unpack it all I suppose. It begins with a simple enough journey on a touring-motorcycle with Robert and his son Chris. It's very raw, real and relatable, but this is only an introduction. The full force of the backstory soon unravels and we slowly learn what's at stake. The philosophical questioning is complimented by the progress they make on their vacation, and eventually you realize that there was never a separation between the philosophy and the journey at all. Though some parts require a little background knowledge of philosophy, I would recommend this book to anyone.

<div><h1>3: Life 3.0 - Max Tegmark</h1>
<p>1-26-19</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_3.0" class="booklink"><img src="images/3.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    Professor at MIT, Max Tegmark peers into the future to give us a hint at what is to come. Filled with uncertainty and guesswork, this was an extensive warning of the barriers humanity will meet when encountering extended intelligence (or artificial intelligence). This book is very well rounded, as it becomes a necessity to discuss physics and philosophy in the approach to properly understanding AI. I thought this book compared well to Nick Bostrom's 'Superintelligence', with Life 3.0 being a little bit less technical. Overall I thought it was a great reminder of the future shock that AI will bring. It may not occur in my lifetime, but regardless we need to think about the coming intelligence explosion like it's on our doorstep.

<h2>
    This was a smaller pocketbook, mainly filled with quotes, but it also has the occasional short story focused on Eastern wisdom. Impermanence and change, contentment, beauty and truth, this is a book that I will bring with me on many journeys, as it is just small enough to carry but filled to the brim with grounding meditations.

<div><h1>5: The Age of Analysis - Morton White</h1>
<p>2-11-19</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3105842-age-of-analysis" class="booklink"><img src="images/5.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This entry in The Mentor Philosophers series analyzes 20th century philosophers with included commentary from a Harvard Professor of Philosophy, Morton White. Each chapter focuses on a specific philosopher, with Morton White giving an introduction of the philosopher's background and influence. The chapter then concludes with selected writing from the philosopher's popular works. I found this style did well at giving each philosopher enough room to argue their point while also providing excellent contrast between the fellow philosopher's of that era. I was very pleased with the balance of Morton White's commentary and the potency of the philosophers' first-hand accounts. I will definitely be looking into the other books in this series.
    <br><br>
    The next time I read through this book I want to take much more detailed notes, with an emphasis on orienting how the vastly different philosophers influenced each other's works.

<div><h1>6: Philosophy: 100 Essential Thinkers - Philip Stokes</h1>
<p>2-21-19</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19217126-philosophy-100-essential-thinkers" class="booklink"><img src="images/6.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    Although this book doesn't go too deep into each philosopher's thinking, it was just enough to show the reader the many comparisons across time. This book is a great way to find new philosophers to study, if one is unfamiliar with the big names. The structure of the book also allows one to use it as reference material, searching up a specific philosopher or time-period to refresh the memory.

<div><h1>7: When Einstein Walked with Gödel - Jim Holt</h1>
<p>3-06-19</p>

<h2>
    Each chapter of this book is a separate essay covering a new topic than the rest, which results in a flow of novelty while remaining true to the themes of mathematics, philosophy and history. This formatting makes me think I will return to it often whenever I want to revisit one of the many interesting essays. Jim Holt's writing is very informative and humorous and I will definitely be looking into his other works.

<div><h1>8: Keys to Creativity - Haris Ward</h1>
<p>3-06-19</p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keys-Creativity-Haris-Ward/dp/1726884481" class="booklink"><img src="images/8.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    Although this piece is rather short and full of typos, it's not meant to be studied and re-visited, but put into action. It is a connection to the infinite that puts creativity in a light of chaotic perfection. It is a call to action.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>9: The 13½ Lives of Captain Bluebear - Walter Moers</h1>
<p>3-26-19</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62032.The_13_Lives_of_Captain_Bluebear" class="booklink"><img src="images/9.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    One of the most unique pieces of fiction I've read, this is an autobiographical tale of Bluebear and his many adventures across Zamonia. Walter's creative world is chock-full of surprising characters with extensive motives and they're all entangled from the beginning to the end. It can be a long read, but I think the exposure to this quirky text was worth it.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>10: The Myth of Sisyphus - Albert Camus</h1>
<p>4-13-19</p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Sisyphus-Essays-ALBERT-CAMUS/dp/B01BITDXFK" class="booklink"><img src="images/10.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This was some of my first "lengthy" exposure to Camus and I'm incredibly impressed by his writing. I'm excited to discover his other works, and see how they relate with this collection. A lot of my experience with his philosophical inquiry was making connections to other schools of thought, and the similar conclusions being made. This is definitely going to be another one I hope to re-read.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>11: HOW TO READ NATURE - Tristan Gooley</h1>
<p>4-20-19</p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Nature-Outdoors-Noticed/dp/1615194290" class="booklink"><img src="images/11.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    One of the biggest first impressions I got from this book was the conscious nod to philosophy and its prevalence in his adventure of awareness. Tristan Gooley has learned how to exist in habitats with a trained perspective that sees connection and harmony. He demonstrates how truth and the quest of knowledge can reveal structures of reality that bring you closer to understanding where you fit in with your environment. With Stoic example, he emphasizes the necessity of conflict, and teaches how we can learn from it in our observations. I was very impressed, it satisfied what I was expecting from this type of book while also presenting a more profound analysis of reality.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>12: Mentors - Russell Brand</h1>
<p>4-28-19</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43251492-mentors" class="booklink"><img src="images/12.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    I first discovered Russell Brand through his comedic routines and then through his podcast, Under the Skin. He's a very witty and lively personality with a clear gift for expressing himself through love and humor. This book is a monologue of his spiritual journey in meeting and learning from his mentors, and how he's been a mentor in his own life. It's less "How to" and more "autobiography", but the writing itself was certainly not bad and it was an enjoyable little read.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>13: The Art of Thinking Clearly - Rolf Dobelli</h1>
<p>5-16-19</p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Thinking-Clearly-Rolf-Dobelli/dp/0062219693" class="booklink"><img src="images/13.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    I took my time getting through this book, I believe it was started in 2018, so it's been a slow trek through what is a topography of the obstacles in the common human mind. Each chapter covers one bias or fallacy in reasoning with accompanying examples, humorous observations and ways to mitigate the error. I thought it was easily grasped and could be a beneficial read to nearly everyone. This isn't one I will quickly return to for re-reading, but I do believe the content in this book is worth remaining aware of. Already have there been times when I have identified real-life examples of what is warned of extensively in The Art of Thinking Clearly.

<div><h1>14: Skin in the Game - Nassim Nicholas Taleb</h1>
<p>5-20-19</p>

<h2>
    I consumed this as an audio book and I enjoyed it. It's an illustration of the importance of taking risks and all the philosophical reasonings behind having "skin in the game". I don't believe this is one that I will re-read, at least not for several years.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>15: Plight of the Living Dead - Matt Simon</h1>
<p>6-05-19</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38496506-plight-of-the-living-dead" class="booklink"><img src="images/15.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    Audiobook. I consumed this rather quickly, and not once did I think "when is this going to end", I just wanted more. Most people give no attention or thought to the common zombies in our environments, they may be creeped out or even afraid of doing so. Matt Simon takes the road less traveled in this thrilling tale through all the most invasive and gut-wrenching parasites known to thrive on zombiefication. Even if you never have to deal with a zombie in your lifetime, this book illustrates how all organisms are deeply connected.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>16: The Book - Alan Watts</h1>
<p>6-30-19</p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Taboo-Against-Knowing-Who/dp/0679723005" class="booklink"><img src="images/16.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This is definitely not my first encounter with Alan Watt's ideas, but it's my first time reading through The Book in entirety. It's a very therapeutic experience, reminding the Self that things are not as serious as they may appear, sincere and playful, yes, but perhaps not the entire story. The central theme is the idea that, the sensation of the Self being separate from the environment is akin to the illusion that the world is flat: it may seem like that from our perspective but investigations into reality clearly dispel the notion. I will surely pick this delightful read up again.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>17: Supermarket - Bobby Hall (Logic)</h1>
<p>7-11-19</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43531103-supermarket" class="booklink"><img src="images/17.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    A quirky tale that is both realistic and outlandish, it approaches through the perspective of an ordinary worker in a Supermarket, but it quickly demonstrates how even the ordinary has a deeper reality to it. It was very memorable, though I don't know if I would re-read it soon, and I wasn't very surprised by the twists and turns but it was still an enjoyable read.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>18: Thus Spake Zarathustra - Friedrich Nietzsche</h1>
<p>7-31-19</p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra-Friedrich-Nietzsche/dp/152193715X" class="booklink"><img src="images/18.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This took me a while to read. Many of the sections I had to go back and re-read, either out of pure enjoyment or plain confusion. I can't pretend to understand everything in this Magnum Opus, but I'm not sure Nietzsche intended for the entirety to be comprehensible. The writing is grandiose, almost like a dramatic play or musical, and the philosophy he preaches comes in parable and metaphor. I very much enjoyed reading it, and will probably peruse through the pages once again.

<div><h1>19: Become What You Are - Alan W. Watts</h1>

<h2>
    I really love this collection of writings. They're very variable in size and style of content, a lot of parts I felt I was reading poetry instead of philosophy or religious discussion. But that may just be the effect of trying to write about something ineffable. I'm very glad I have this as a part of my collection and I look forward to adding more Alan Watts to my library.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>20: wanderings - haris ward</h1>
<p>8-19-19</p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wanderings-Haris-Ward/dp/1796532193" class="booklink"><img src="images/20.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This was a fantastic experience. It is a true journey, filled with wisdom and beauty. It was one of those books where once I started reading I couldn't really stop. There are wonderful illustrations that tie the whole thing together. There are a few typos here and there but at the same time, it's poetry, so I can't REALLY say that they're typos.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>21: Energy and Civilization - Vaclav Smil</h1>
<p>10-4-19</p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Energy-Civilization-History-MIT-Press/dp/0262035774" class="booklink"><img src="images/21.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This is a comprehensive and detailed historical account of energy usage and its affects. Smil walks us through our relationship with energy by providing specific metrics and great comparative examples. It seems to present information with as little bias as possible, while still confronting the barriers and advantages to the various forms of energy we have encountered. I don't see myself re-reading this for some time, but I thought it did a good job at demonstrating the importance of thinking in terms of energy flows.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>22: Pocket Taoist Wisdom - Thomas Cleary</h1>
<p>10-20-19</p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Taoist-Wisdom-Shambhala-Library/dp/1611806941" class="booklink"><img src="images/22.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This is a great little book. It's tiny enough to carry around (pocket book) and I have brought it with me on several adventures. Great for quick reading. It contains translations for the Tao Te Ching, Chuang-tzu, Huai-nan-tzu, Wen-tzu, Tales of inner meaning, and Sayings of ancestor Lu. If you're unfamiliar with taoist or zen philosophy you could even regard it as a poetry book. It reaches those poetic and lofty heights that one must access to even begin an attempt at describing Tao. I'm very glad this is in my collection and I think it will be a companion to me for quite some time.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>23: Astrophysics for People in a Hurry - Neil deGrasse Tyson</h1>
<p>11-28-19</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191710-astrophysics-for-people-in-a-hurry" class="booklink"><img src="images/23.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This is a nice little science appetizer for those who are interested in the cosmos. It doesn't go in-depth with any of the concepts that it shares, but that's the point. It's more like a collection of possible routes of exploration. It does a good job at demonstrating how little we really know about our position in this universe, and it also takes the time to sneak in a little history lesson now and then. It was released in 2017 so it's not too outdated, which can be an important thing to consider when reviewing the frontier sciences. I really appreciated the ending that discussed the "cosmic perspective", and how an understanding of the greater picture can change our interaction with the scale of reality we are used to. I won't be re-reading this anytime soon, but that's because I would like to move onto more detailed discussions of astrophysics.

<div><h1>24: Buddha's Brain - Rick Hanson, PhD</h1>
<p>12-9-19</p>
<a href="https://www.rickhanson.net/books/buddhas-brain/" class="booklink"><img src="images/24.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    I thought this was a good mixture of philosophy, history, neuroscience, and guided meditation. I love learning about the brain, so the presentation of neuroscience with a focus on the enlightened state was very interesting. The author seems to be very informed on the subject and he does his best to explain the important pieces to a layman while staying on topic. Personally I skipped over the guided meditation, which doesn't mean they aren't useful, but I just prefer silent meditation. I can see a time when these guided meditations would be very appreciated. I'm going to recommend this book to anyone interested in self-exploration.

<div><h1>25: The Story of Philosophy - Will Durant</h1>
<p>12-22-19</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31795.The_Story_of_Philosophy" class="booklink"><img src="images/25.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    I thought this was an extensive, well-written exploration of the prominent philosophers throughout history. Of course not everyone can be included, but those that are included are covered with an evident passion and due diligence. There are lots of quotes and excerpts from the specific philosophers, which I enjoyed, along with Will's commentary. I'm interested to see how it compares with Russel's History of Western Philosophy, which I have read chapters of but not in entirety. Ultimately I'm very glad to have come across this tomb of history and thought.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>26: The Doors of Perception &amp; Heaven and Hell - Aldous Huxley</h1>
<p>1-5-20</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5128.The_Doors_of_Perception_Heaven_and_Hell" class="booklink"><img src="images/26.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    I thought that, for something written in 1956, this was an interesting exploration of the relationship between psychedelics and the human mind. This copy included two works that went well together, and you can see the thread of thought continuing in Huxley's mind through the separate works. For something as nebulous as psychedelics (and psychology), Huxley tries to explore the interactions while being as grounded as possible, bringing in examples from art history as well as mental disabilities like schizophrenia. Even approaching the writing with a completely neutral perspective on the content, the writing flows with the same artistry that Huxley is known for. I don't think I'll be rereading this in the near future, as there isn't a lot of technical content that needs to be digested longterm, but I am definitely interested in his many other works.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>27: Dune - Frank Herbert</h1>
<p>2-24-20</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune" class="booklink"><img src="images/27.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    Shortly after I discovered Dune and decided it was worth exploring, I started noticing references to it almost immediately. People in my social media network started talking about it, some were reading it for the first time. This is typically a good sign for me, and I'm glad that even today people are coming to learn and appreciate Dune. I only read the first novel, which was separated into three "books", but you really do need to read the first three to allow the story to unfold. Something that initially jumped out to me was the amount of philosophical and spiritual textures that are woven throughout the world that Frank Herbert has created. It wasn't something I was expecting but it's always appreciated when a work can touch on something deeper than the constant fast-paced action we are used to seeing almost universally. With that said there is still a good amount of action, with some scenes that are building up momentum through the entire story. Even though finishing it was very satisfying, and it did feel like things were being concluded, I still got the sense that this was only the beginning. It took three books to set up the foundation of the story, and now the true power moves must be made. I do think I will continue reading this series, just not immediately. I need to take a little bit to let the epicness of it all to digest.

<div><h1>28: The Moon is a Harsh Mistress - Robert A Heinlein</h1>
<p>3-25-20</p>
<a href="https://archive.org/details/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress_201701" class="booklink"><img src="images/28.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    I took my time reading this book. I think I got distracted from it about halfway through, but I finally found the time to complete it and was not disappointed. Not only is it interesting from a political and philosophical standpoint, it's something that seems right around Humanity's corner. The struggles of communities living within the domains of larger societies that don't treat them with equal rights. What started as a prison planet can't stay that way when generations of people have made it their home. Sharing gravity wells but refusing to share fairly. Ultimately it comes down to force, who can sustain the force longest, and the intelligence required to direct that force. Even though Mike was never a flesh-and-blood character that we are so used to relating to, I felt a connection to him consistently throughout the story, and it has persisted through the end.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>29: 21 Lessons for the 21st Century - Yuval Noah Harari</h1>
<p>5-20-20</p>
<a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/21-lessons-book/" class="booklink"><img src="images/29.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    The beginning of this book was very much different than the end. The problems that Yuval presumes will arise for humanity aren't anything simple to resolve or even easy to understand. They are wide in scope, and often require a new lens of reality in order to consider. So he does his best in demonstrating the different lenses we could view the future with, and I believe he does a good job.
    <br><br>
    He explains the danger of certainty. He outlines how humanity uses narrative, story, or fiction to shape our interaction with reality. He understands that the solution isn't as simple as writing a book, letting the readers digest it and voila everything is solved. It's a nuanced situation we find ourselves in, and he actually does very well detailing the nuances.
    <br><br>
    The examples he give are easy for a layman to relate to, and they even open territory that the philosopher is so used to navigating. He attempts to unite both spaces, showing that these aren't confined to specific professions, but they concern us all.
    <br><br>
    And he concludes with anecdotal testimony to how he arrived at his position, what has helped him in the present, namely, he goes on to describe how the Self that we autonomously form a narrative for isn't as stable as it seems, and that meditation can open yet another perspective for us to approach reality through. He tries to explain that the mind, or consciousness, is one of the most mysterious phenomena available to us, and exploring it is available to everybody.

<h2>
    This novel starts out with some pretty heighty promises, but through several detours and elaborations the greater story is slowly brought into view. And it's an intricate story, for sure. Even in the beginning, the concepts introduced put me in a captivated state that altered my perspective of the reality I inhabit. As the story progressed, this altered perspective only became more believable, and even more shocking. The ideas presented in the book could be felt to possibly occur in real life as well, right in your back yard. The more impressive miracles are explained in a scientific way so that you feel like it's a real possibility. In the end I feel like this is just the introduction, a lot of setup for a grander story arc, but even this setup was incredibly entertaining. The author has a way of keeping you hooked through and through. I finished the book incredibly fast. It's a science fiction series that I will need to return to, perhaps after I read a bit more of the Dune series.

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35960136-the-golden-ratio" class="booklink"><img src="images/31.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    I think this is the first book I've read about Phi (or, the golden ratio, or 1.618) and it was pretty impressive. I think there's some fairly solid evidence that demonstrates this has been a recurring theme through history, either kept as a secret for the intellectually privileged, or as a forgotten habit that was inherited from an earlier time. I don't know where I stand as to what the golden ratio really is. Maybe it's just a pattern of measurement that we can overlay onto things, like an inch? But then again, if the golden ratio can lend value to things like the construction of plants and organisms, for whatever reason, then it must have some foundation in physical reality. Whatever that means.
    <br><br>
    I thought the book did a good job demonstrating Phi's prevalence throughout life. It didn't do such a good job at exploring possible explanations, but to be fair that's a pretty big job in itself. You have to start addressing things like philosophy of beauty, which he attempts to do in little spurts. Something I would like to explore is how I can employ Phi in my own works. Can I actually use it to predict financial trends? Can I incorporate it into my visual arts to create a sense of balance, unity, and divinity? I don't know. Nevertheless, it's very intriguing. I don't think this will be the last book I read about Phi.

<div><h1>32: Foundation - Isaac Asimov</h1>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29579.Foundation" class="booklink"><img src="images/32.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    The main premise of the series, that historical patterns could be mathematically charted and extrapolated into the future, is a very interesting foundation for a story, if I dare say so. Much of the 'mathematical extrapolation of history' relies on the participants of history being mostly unaware of the details, which leaves lots of room for twists and turns along the way. It was fun to explore how a civilization could prepare itself for independency, even if said civilization has little material resources, but lots of knowledge and time for preparation.
    <br><br>
    'Foundation' was an investigation of societal balances, an investigation of what truly matters toward the continuation of an ideal. The multi-generational plot has somewhat of an end goal in mind, a hazy idea of what problems will interfere with that end goal, and a lot of drama as you might expect when dealing with large populations. Even though this is set in the distant future, the economic and political instability that I see in my "base reality" makes me think that this could almost be a manual of questions to pose for today. What knowledge is worth preserving? How can we minimize the more chaotic stages of a kyklos cycle? And ultimately, what is to come, and who has predicted the most accurate picture of the coming reality?
    <br><br>
    I will definitely have to continue this story after I revisit a few other sci-fi series that I've been neglecting: Three-Body Problem, Dune.

<div><h1>33: The Power of Myth - Joseph Campbell</h1>

<h2>
    This is a dialogue between Bill Moyers and the great Joseph Campbell, and while I didn't always love the questions that Moyers proposed, he did a good job at covering ground that is pertinent to the material at hand. By this I mean that, the topics being discussed aren't exactly clear as daylight, and so further elaboration can be required to really dig deep into the root of the matter. Moyers served well as this advocate for elaboration, and even if Campbell sometimes repeats a previously stated message, it's in good nature, and these lessons do deserve repetition. If you're totally unfamiliar with Campbell's work but you're a lover of story, philosophy, history, or the human experience of life, then Campbell has some beautiful insight to share with you. Campbell's experience seems to have no limitations in regards to culture, he freely draws from whatever is inspiring. This habit of drawing wisdom from where-ever it shows itself results in a well-rounded perspective that Campbell is more than happy to share. I related quite heavily with what Campbell has to say. I think the next book that I read by Campbell will be The Hero With a Thousand Faces.

<div><h1>34: The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect - Roger Williams</h1>
<p>June 2020</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64341.The_Metamorphosis_of_Prime_Intellect" class="booklink"><img src="images/34.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    First of all, this is one of the most graphic books I've read, both of a violent and sexual nature, but the sheer intensity that the author employs isn't without reason. It's exactly what I think would be the natural occurrence if the book's story was to unfold. It wasn't all pleasant, and much of it was over the top, but it was believable according to the narrative. With that aside, this book is something that I could completely believe. Written in 1994, it stands true to the possibilities that we have ahead of us. And it may seem crazy, but it might even be unfolding this very moment. Even if you are in total disbelief of the novel's extremity, I felt that it was pertinent commentary on the state of technology in relation to man. Are we in charge of technology? Did we ever have a choice as to technology's outcome? Can technology be regulated to maximize its goodness, or will there always be both good and bad outcomes? While a small and quick read, it was filled to the brim.

<div><h1>35: Dune Messiah - Frank Herbert</h1>
<p>July 2020</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44492285-dune-messiah?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2u992QNLV0&rank=2" class="booklink"><img src="images/35.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This book was another wonderful reminder to Frank Herbert's incredible literary dancing. Frank doesn't pick and choose between "remarkable story" and "impressive prose", but welds both into a coherent world that is incredibly enjoyable every step of the way.
    <br><br>
    If the first book in the series was about raising up the Fremen to their own independence, then this book details the intricacies involved in maintaining that transition, or more specifically, government. For this reason, many will not recognize the same Muad'Dib as the first book portrayed, but I thought this was a very pertinent side to Paul that we are shown. Being an Emperor comes with certain costs to personality and conduct. At the same time, Paul is approaching the very event that he has made such desperation to avoid. It was an impressive story arc, another solid development in the world of Dune.

<div><h1>36: The Dark Forest - Liu Cixin</h1>
<p>July 2020 </p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=kyH3KPpuan&rank=1" class="booklink"><img src="images/36.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This is such a good series. The book has a very strong sense of unity. It all ties together very neatly, and it's incredibly satisfying to watch all the pieces come together. This is also a sci-fi series that I can easily find believable. The concepts are definitely beyond the scope of present technology, but you can follow the fundamental logic without losing your grip on the story.
    <br><br>
    Filled with action, suspense, love, mystery, and just plain beautiful writing. And there's still two more book for me to read, one written by Liu Cixin and another written as fanfic that was then endorsed by Liu.
    <br><br>
    The dark forest extrapolation, or the analysis of cosmic sociology, is very heavy. I don't want to speak too much on it as it's somewhat of a spoiler, but I found it chilling. It makes sense, to me. So maybe instead of trying to go to Mars, and instead of beaming signals and probes into space, maybe we should be building a cloak to hide Earth, and fix this place up for the long run. While staying as quiet as possible.

<div><h1>37: Death's End - Liu Cixin</h1>
<p>August 20</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25451264-death-s-end?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=dGIYSURSte&rank=1" class="booklink"><img src="images/37.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This was some of the best sci-fi I've ever read. I don't know if everyone would call it "hard sci-fi", but I think the author tried to be as realistic as possible. Even with the fantastical ideas of pushing the limits of physics and trying to reverse-engineer the vastly diverse species in the cosmos, he makes it very believable and easy to follow along, all while blowing my mind several times with each book.
    <br><br>
    I think this series reinstated my love for science fiction. It's important to realize that a lot of these concepts are right around the corner for Humanity. I don't think these "fictional" possibilities are things we can put off, I think they involve society on every level. Even if we don't come close to approaching space travel, or trying to protect our planet from the greater cosmos, our children at least will have to start tackling these questions. And I think sci-fi is a good starting point to expand our perspective of what exactly might be achievable.
    <br><br>
    Ultimately this was a very enjoyable series. It can be a bit long at times but I felt it was necessary to fully explain the details. None of it felt like fluff or just trying to hit a word limit, it was all very vital to the story. I would say you can't just read one of these books and end it there, the whole series is a package that I will recommend to anyone who looks up at the stars and wonders.

<div><h1>38: Oceanic - Greg Egan</h1>
<p>8-24-20</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6741362-oceanic?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=CW8RfeiF7k&rank=1" class="booklink"><img src="images/38.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    The version I read contained several short stories that served as a prelude to the finale, 'Oceanic'. Initially the most striking aspect was how diverse the settings and storylines were. Greg Egan's range of creation in sci-fi seems intergalactic in scale, but he does tend to stick to hard scientific concepts which require a little bit of background understanding.
    <br><br>
    Oceanic is a suspenseful short that details the long journey of coming to terms with certain harsh facts about reality. It's presented in the same hard sci-fi universe, but in this short the advanced setting is just a foundation to express deeper questions.
    <br><br>
    This is an author that addresses a wide range of sensitive topics, mostly of a philosophical bend. That may not be for everyone but in my case I found the topics to be very pertinent to our own age. I will absolutely be reading more Egan.
</h2></div>

<div><h1>39: The Lessons of History - Will Durant</h1>
<p>8-26-20</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History" class="booklink"><img src="images/39.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This was a very short collection of essays, but the brevity didn't detract from the writing at all. You don't learn about fine details of any specific historical events, but Durant paints a picture of what he sees as the largest over-arching patterns throughout Human time. And due to the scale of his goal - which is more concerned with 'history as a whole' than anything - he mentions the Philosopher quite a lot. By that I mean it's clear that Durant has a philosophical-bent, and he appreciates the role of philosophy throughout Human development, and he's careful to demonstrate that side of history for us. This doesn't mean that this is a book for or about philosophers, just that Durant finds it necessary to include that archetype (which I appreciated).
    <br><br>
    I thought the writing was splendid. Even with something like History, which many people can find dull, Durant's writing is so lively and clever that it compels you to keep reading. Beyond the writing, the substance of the thing was satisfying. I think it helps to know a little history when reading this, as it feels more like a refresher than an introducer. It reminds you of the great journey that took us to where we are now, and of course, the great journey ahead of us.

<div><h1>40: Zen in the Art of Archery - Eugen Herrigel</h1>
<p>8-27-20</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/103758.Zen_in_the_Art_of_Archery?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=PlVhKw9uzA&rank=1" class="booklink"><img src="images/40.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    Very short, but worth it. While trying to speak of zen is like biting your teeth, this book does so in a roundabout and entertaining way by speaking of the art of archery. A few years ago, I was practicing the sport of precision marksmanship (I attained the badge of "expert marksman" and then stopped), and so I found this book very relatable. The marksman fundamentally aims at himself. However, I have a feeling that this book would resonate to even someone without any training in marksmanship, archery, or the like. I highly recommend it, it's a beautiful experience.

<div><h1>41: Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography</h1>

<h2>
    This wasn't something I would normally read with enthusiasm, but I've been wanting to know a bit more history, for one, and also, it was included in the Harvard Universal Classics, so here we are. I don't regret reading it. Not all of it was thrilling, but it was a very interesting insight into a man that I otherwise would only hear bits and pieces of, or rather, the prominent reasons for his fame.
    <br><br>
    Ben Franklin was clearly a generalist. He let his interests guide him, and they brought him many places. If anything, I believe that Franklin's life was a testament to self-discovery, as well as the self-education that accompanies such a process. It's really quite shocking just how many things he did for his local community, and then gradually the world at large. I can understand why this would be the first to the Harvard Universal Classics, as a role model such as Benjamin Franklin would be hard to steer you wrong.

<h2>
    Once again the variety that Egan deploys is incredible. He does have a preference for sci-fi, but I think I'm beginning to see that he isn't in love with the sci-fi itself, but only that the sci-fi is what is required for him to drive home his point. He has these philosophical questions that can't be put in a simple question, but must be lived, through the perspective of a character, to explore the question in finality. And following the question to its depth usually has a profound, lingering taste to it. As I've said before, Egan might put some people off, and I can understand why, but I very much enjoy his works.

<div><h1>43: The Fifth Science - Exurb1a</h1>

<h2>
    I had never read this author's writing before, but I was familiar with his YouTube channel. I really liked this book. Composed of multiple sci-fi shorts, the diverse works carry the theme of the philosophical questions of mind, and what becomes of the Universe, or even the galactic empire as we know it when we conquer The Fifth Science. This seems like a book that was written for its age, where we are already dealing with artificial intelligences that are convincing, productive, or just plain silly. We don't yet consider these artificial intelligences (or "arties" in the book) as sentient, but even the layman has to eventually ask the question: at what point will science transform matter into something radically new and alive?
    <br><br>
    I enjoyed the writing. The narration was slightly casual at times, and he likes to try and get a chuckle, but most of it was very set on creating a world for you to experience and I think he succeeded. There are twists and turns, revelations, soft moments, and cliff hangers. But I think, most importantly, these aren't just lofty ideals that might someday come true. I believe these are real questions that we as a society will have to face, eventually, maybe in a thousand years, maybe in a hundred. And for that reason alone I think books like these are worth the time, just so that we can take a glimpse into a possible future, see how it makes us feel, consider it, and maybe even create lasting changes.
    <br><br>
    I will be reading more Exurb1a.

<div><h1>44: Range - David Epstein</h1>

<h2>
    This was a great read and I think it was the perfect size. It was just long enough to bring in a lot of examples, and just short enough to keep my attention on the many different ways that generalists can thrive. This isn't a book that tries to say that specialization is a waste, but it demonstrates that we need both sides of the spectrum. Experimentation and innovation doesn't operate with an end goal in mind, it has to be a little inefficient in some areas to find the undiscovered efficiency that can be integrated from diverse fields that would otherwise be thought of as separate.
    <br><br>
    Ultimately I think the underlying message of this book is to follow your curiosity. We can't know everything in advance that will be profitable or valuable to our lives, and lessons learned in one specialty can be applied to other new ventures. And the other beautiful message is that you're not behind, if you feel a desire to explore something new then don't feel too afraid to "fall behind the crowd", it might just turn into a new magical combination.

<h2>
    Another awesome collection by Egan. The large majority of the stories I read by Egan are satisfying the exact desire I have for sci-fi, which is something like being both weird and believable, pushing the edges of reality while still trying to exist within a logical framework. When the rules are broken they are done so in a way that feels creative and thrilling, and not at all like cheating.
    <br><br>
    Egan's characters aren't the best I've ever encountered, but they haven't distracted me from the stories. The arcs that the characters take are inseparable from the larger scientific narrative that he builds, and the diversity of his writing is just as enjoyable as always. This collection follows the same "hard sci-fi" pattern, where knowing some background knowledge of nerdy stuff can be a tremendous aid to understanding and inhabiting the worlds that Egan constructs, but I wouldn't say you need to be a rocket scientist to enjoy his works.

<div><h1>46: Dispersion - Greg Egan</h1>

<h2>
    I honestly didn't love this one. I wouldn't say it was bad; it was definitely creative, not something I've imagined in a world, but it wasn't groundbreaking or mindblowing. The most prominent feature of the book was the scientific method, and the trials that are required of investigating a totally foreign process. In a way it felt like social commentary, with everyone pointing fingers at everyone else, and only a few actually trying to make progress. In the end I didn't feel very satisfied, things were resolved in a way but I wasn't left as much information about the Dispersion as I would've hoped.
    <br><br>
    It was short so I didn't lose much time by reading it, but it's not one that I think I would return to. Worth a couple bucks and a rainy afternoon if you're the type who likes investigative science and weird settings.

<div><h1>47: John Woolman's Autobiography</h1>
<p>9-20-20</p>

<h2>
    I can only recommend this read to those interested in Quakers or Abolitionist-history. Most of the book's contents are descriptions of his travels, usually to visit other Quakers, and it becomes very repetitive. He visits this town, sees these people, has a meeting where he is inspired by the Divine Love and then moves on. This seems to be the majority of the book, but it's not the entirety. There are bits and pieces that I found of value; it is certainly interesting to see from the perspective of a Quaker in the 1700's. But near the end I was definitely more excited to finish and move on than reading the next chapter.
    <br><br>
    I can't blame him for his writing as he begins the book by saying he wishes to write something as a testament to his God, and he does so. Many times through his travels he talks about how weak he is, how sad he becomes from seeing slaves and the like, and how God transformed his mind and gave him peace. He also talks about the blessing of frugality, meekness, and the temptations of wealth, which I appreciated as that's a side of Christianity that we don't really see these days.
    <br><br>
    There was one part where he describes an angel coming to him at night, in the form of a sphere of light, and he only writes a sentence or two about it. I wish he talked more about that, it felt strange to mention such an experience and then move on without very much commentary. I don't think I will revisit this anytime soon.

<h2>
    This was my favorite of the other Quaker's writings. Written in Enchiridion-form, Penn tries to squeeze as much wisdom into his journals as he can. I agreed with a lot of it, in parts I gained some insight, and in others I didn't know what he was saying. There is a language barrier between now and the ~1700's. I enjoyed it, it didn't take too much time to read, but I don't think I will re-read it at least for quite some time.

<div><h1>49: The Apology, and Crito, by Plato</h1>

<h2>
    I'm including both The Apology and Crito as one review because they follow the same events and I finished them on the same day, but I have yet to finish Phaedo. I do really love these writings. It's not the first time I've read them but it's always nice to revisit. In an age like ours, it's quite striking to see someone with a dedication to virtue and reason instead of the passions of the body. Socrates, whether he was real or not, demonstrates that a man with values should hold onto them even to the very end. And it's obviously easier said than done, but there's something moving about hearing of Socrates speak his own testimony for the cause behind his actions. Another aspect I love is his willingness to obey God's commands, if his time has come then he embraces it with a happiness, for he knows he has acted within his own virtues. He lives with a love of fate.
    <br><br>
    This isn't something that only philosophers should read, I definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone. They're not very long or hard to understand, so give it a shot.

<h2>
    This was a really cool story. At first it starts out simple enough, the progression of computer science enabling all the wonderful and strange things that it does, but then the view pans out and we are left staring at something so vast that it's hard to wrap your head around. I'll once again try to avoid anything too detailed for the sake of those who want to read it, but the hard sci-fi holds true to Egan's reputation. Fantastical and scientific while attempting to be grounded in the realm of plausibility, but simultaneously so outlandish that it leaves you reeling.
    <br><br>
    There are many philosophical questions in this, but Egan would rather watch them dance together in the uncertain and unfolding future than try to face them head on and reduce them to certainties. If you're interested in consciousness, or computer science, or exotic ideas of maths, I can highly recommend this, and even if you're not I would say give it a shot. This was a very fun, mind-bending read.

<h2>
    This was an interesting development in the story. It was kind of short, but entertaining through and through. There was a big twist, which is always fun, even if I did have suspicions of it from the beginning. This book sort of felt like a bridge between the first book and the third, like it's setting the stage for the next in line while also bringing the reader up to speed on the happenings in the first. I'm excited to read the third in this series, but I also want to read more Dune.

<div><h1>52: Phaedo - Plato</h1>

<h2>
    I think Phaedo is less about what is being discussed and more about how it's being discussed. This is the iconic Socrates-on-his-death-bed, and so there are discussions about the soul and other things that one might wish to talk about as they approach death, though Socrates doesn't choose these topics out of his own concern but for the concern of his friends. One of the most striking aspects is how fearless Socrates was said to be in the face of death. His reasoning was that he spent a life well lived, in pursuit of virtue instead of wealth and therefore he was ready for death. He accepted his fate with love, with a belief that for him to obey God's will is the highest of goals. It's not a very long read and I definitely recommend it.

<h2>
    Egan did another great job with this book, however I can't recommend it to everyone. The storyline heavily features things like neural implants and quantum mechanics which necessarily raise the question of Free Will along the entire way. If those things even slightly interest you then I highly recommend it. It was a great journey, filled with mystery, suspense, and the feeling of awe that Egan so reliably delivers.

<div><h1>54: The Golden Sayings of Epictetus</h1>

<h2>
    Stoicism was one of the first schools of philosophy that I started exploring so it's always enjoyable for me to revisit the great Stoics. I haven't read much Epictetus and I enjoyed it, however at times the translation was a bit confusing, and I couldn't agree with everything Epictetus says. At one point he talks about how we should live without excess luxury, but then he says that having servants (read, slaves) attend to our house or dinner parties isn't luxurious. I understand that having a few slaves was just part of the age and culture, but for a Philosopher who talks a lot about introspection and the importance of frugality it just seems strange that he would have accepted slaves (or even paid servants for that matter) as frugal, part of Nature's Plan, instead of a bit over the top. Maybe he only needed them in his older age?
    <br><br>
    Ultimately I'm glad I read this. He mentions God often in his discussions, and if this would put anyone off I would suggest mentally replacing God with "All that is". He doesn't try to fit God within a specific doctrine or set of rules and traditions, instead he approaches God as one would approach a love of Fate, or Amor Fati. The idea of Stoicism is that the human concerns himself with what is in his control (which is often very little) and that God, or Fate, or what is outside of our control is ultimately for the best, and we should love the Will of God. He also mixes this idea of God with Nature, however he doesn't expand a lot upon what is Nature and what isn't.

<h2>
    This felt pretty chaotic. There were certainly some interesting parts, as well as some boring parts, but overall it's not too bad considering the year it was written (1972). You'll want some interest in the brain to read this book, as well as a tiny understanding of computers to follow the theme. The author thinks of the brain as a computer, which is a generally agreeable perspective but he doesn't go too deep into the computer science aspect of things besides utilizing some computer-science-esque terminology.
    <br><br>
    He kind of jumped around, there wasn't strong cohesion to the book's progression. This isn't a deal-breaker for me, it was just a bit jarring at times. The most interesting portion of this book for me was his reporting on psychoanalysis of patients who were in isolation / float chambers, deprived of sensation and then given LSD. He reports some interesting observations, and tries to remain objective and observant, but in the end he chalks up the LSD-braincomputer-interaction as basically LSD introduces noise into the computer system and that's the cause of the LSD experiences. This might be a partial explanation but I didn't think it was much of a conclusion. At least he attempted an observation I suppose. It was short so I don't regret reading it.

<h2>
    This was a fun read, very eerie. I had watched the movie before reading this, so it was a little spoiled but still enjoyable. Something I like about books like these are that it makes you appreciate what we have. The world may be a little topsy-turvy, but it's not 'alien invasion' level chaos, which we don't often consider. There's nothing to say that we won't ever be invaded by aliens; maybe not Martians, granted, but the book is still a creepy reminder to appreciate our uncontested Earth soil.
    <br><br>
    Another aspect I appreciated was how little action there was. It was more suspenseful than action. It's not exactly what you could call a war, the humans have very little impact against the Martians, which I think added to the realism. And to avoid spoilers that's all I'll say. I can see why H.G. Wells is one of the classic sci-fi authors.

<h2>
    Pretty good story. This was another classic that I knew about before actually reading it so the narrative was slightly spoiled but still an enjoyable read. The story has less to do with the paradoxes of time travel, which a lot of creators seem to jump on whenever time travel comes up, but instead Wells takes this opportunity to peer into the possibilities of the developmental progression of society and humanity as a species. This was largely believable, Wells seems pretty thorough in trying to impart a level of realism.
    <br><br>
    It was clearly influenced by the sociological discussions of his time (the worker versus the owner) but I didn't think it was so heavy that it ruined anything. In the end, the time machine was more of a means to discussing the distant-future sociology instead of the concept of time travel itself, which was fine and good but still I think an important distinction.

<h2>
    I loved this book. It's a topic that I've been pondering for over four years now, and it was really exciting to find something so relatable. This book is pretty extensive, it has plenty of examples and data to back up the presented arguments. While in a sense it only scratched the surface, it's also one of the most thorough works I've found on the subject. I highly recommend it if you're interested in the phenomena of order, information, or economics.

<h2>
    This was a pretty fun read. Parts of it were hard to understand. Not scientifically confusing, just kind of vague or written strangely. But maybe that's just me. I'm not saying it was written poorly, just that portions left me a little confused. Ultimately it's a fun story. This is a book that I would recommend to people who are wanting to dip their toes into sci-fi, as it's not super steeped in sci-fi but the setting is just futuristic enough to be a nice introduction to the sci-fi style of worldbuilding.

<div><h1>60: The Invisible Man - H.G. Wells</h1>
<p>11-7-20</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17184.The_Invisible_Man?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=ggDFbCOBiD&rank=2" class="booklink"><img src="images/60.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    I was surprised by the direction that Wells took this story. Before reading, I had assumed that the majority of the narrative would be a slow, suspenseful investigation into the mystery surrounding the backstory of the invisible man. However most of the backstory of the invisible man was revealed early in the introduction, and in true "Wellsian fashion", the rest of the narrative was focused around the power that being invisible would bring to man, and how the mad scientist archetype could abuse this fantastic power.
    <br><br>
    It was definitely written for its own time. Being invisible isn't something that many would seriously think of as a superpower, especially once you consider the specific circumstances that would be required for that power to be used. There are other, wilder science fiction scenarios that can yield great power, but there's something down-to-earth about an invisible man. What I mean to say is that it's a very human fear to wonder about an invisible evil-doer, but in the end it's not the worst sci-fi disaster that could happen. I do recommend this read, especially if you enjoy the "absolute power corrupts absolutely" narrative.

<h2>
    I'm a big fan of Campbell's work, and this had the same rock-solid quality that he consistently delivers. It was a bit less extensive than the other book I read (The Power of Myth) but it was still well worth the read. This book was more focused on Christianity, which I could appreciate as I was raised Methodist, and though I no longer self-identify with that label I still appreciate the teachings of Jesus Christ, even if I don't fully agree with the modern interpretations.
    <br><br>
    I have a feeling I will be studying Campbell for my entire life, as he seems to be a wellspring of wisdom that is eternally refilling.

<h2>
    This was basic, but not too basic considering it's an introduction. Jung seems to be a very prolific and wide-ranging character, and this was a nice appetizer to his collection of works. I would like to read more Jung, but I'm not exactly sure where to start, possibly the Red Book. I own a paperback version of his 'Synchronicity' which I have so far neglected, but I might just have to buckle down and study it, as synchronicity is definitely an interest of mine. The graphics in this book didn't always contribute to understanding the content but it incorporated a nice balance throughout.

<h2>
    I'm coming to understand that words fall short of the most fundamental truths in life. Even in spite of this we still attempt to share our understandings with others, and the Gita is another timeless expression of that. A good portion of this book deals with "surface level material", but there are definitely nuggets of truth if you are sincere about listening to them. I think I will need to reread this, or find different translations to study.

<h2>
    This was one of those books that saddened me as I reached the end. Even knowing all things come to pass, I wanted this to go on and on, however I think what I truly desire is just to have met Alan Watts in person. I recommend this read to anyone interested in Alan Watts "the person", as while he does talk about his philosophies (as they are manifestations of his life), they are not the sole focus of the book. In true Watts' fashion, he speaks a lot about the people that he loved throughout his life, as you cannot have an idea of Self without the Other. I think what's truly special about this book is that it has no specifically intended message. His other works seem to focus on a topic that he tries to convey to the reader, while in this autobiography he is given the space (nothingness) required to truly play with whatever he desired in that moment.
    <br><br>
    PS: I just realized this is the 64th entry in my book-reviews, which reminds me of the 64 trigrams of the I Ching. A satisfying coincidence, or maybe more, I will let you decide.

<h2>
    This was a helpful primer for developing healthy investing habits. They start from the bottom, assuming the reader needs help along the entire way. This led to me skimming through some parts but most of it was insightful. I can say that reading this had a direct impact on my investing practices. While finance can be an overwhelming subject, with taxes and insurance forming their own respective armies of complexity, this book is a solid introduction to the path of fiscal responsibility. It's not the only book you'll need, but they include references to other works that might be of value. I will most likely read more from the Bogleheads in the future.

<h2>
    This is a sizeable book, and although I'm not often a fiction reader this was a captivating read. Being the first in the series it definitely serves as an introduction to the larger setting at play, but it doesn't fail to excite and inspire questions. There's a decent amount of action scenes, which I'm not usually a huge fan of, but they aren't drawn out or over-dramatic. The action is always for a cause, it's never mindless bloodshed or just trying to fill pages.
    <br><br>
    The heart of this book for me was the world building. I won't spoil anything, but there's a solid amount of diverse creatures, mystery, metaphysics, intricate economics as well as some history that is slowly revealed. It's a very interesting setting that Sanderson has developed, and in the words of my friend, it's not just world building but universe building. I believe Sanderson refers to his universe as the Cosmere.
    <br><br>
    What first struck me about Sanderson's writing is the dialogue. Conversations are something that is easy to do but hard to master, and if Sanderson hasn't mastered it then he's at least very close to mastery. I love the characters and I'm very excited to see how they grow as the story progresses.

<h2>
    This is a rather short collection, and there are a few noticeable typos, but the parables don't need to be long or perfectly translated to still be meaningful. Not all of them were easily understood, but I thought most of them were a beautiful representation of that which cannot easily be named or described with words. I've been a longtime fan of Koans and eastern wisdom so some of the stories I have heard before but they were appreciated nonetheless. There are pictures included with some of the stories, and I didn't feel they were very necessary but at times they were a nice touch.

<h2>
    I'm totally loving this series. It really does feel like it hasn't even built up to the climax, but it has been very entertaining all the same. The story contains normalized things like sword battles, magic sects and the like, but they all have their own original twist that makes it very compelling and gives the world a rich texture. The characters remain extremely interesting and it's hard for me to choose a favorite, I don't think I could if you demanded it. I am reading other books alongside this series, however it seems like this has taken up the majority of my reading time. I immediately bought the next in the series and I am dearly excited to see how the plot develops.

<h2>
    This was a major culmination in the Stormlight Archives. It's hard for me to censor myself, as I want to talk about the juicy details but I know I wouldn't be doing this series justice. We are starting to understand so much more of the background, what's at stake, who the major players are in this fight for Roshar. I love it. Not only for the philosophy and the underlying message, but for the comedy, the suspense, the surprising action scenes, and the top tier dialogue.

<h2>
    This addition in the series highlights just how much things are beginning to ramp up. New players are introduced, new mysteries of epic proportion, and some other background details are filled in to really satisfy some of the questions we've been asking. And of course, the new answers leave many new questions as well. It was a much shorter read than the other Stormlight books I've enjoyed, but I thought it was a fitting size. Sanderson does a very good job at laying the foundation for the story and then slowly developing on what is a very satisfying world to explore. Reading this series has been a pleasant break from some of the hard sci-fi that I had been consumed by.

<h2>
    This book, being the conjunction of finance and psychology, was a very interesting read. Lucky for me, you don't need to be an expert in either to appreciate this book, as the author succinctly incudes the important aspects of both topics without being weighted down by unnecessary conclusions. He applies psychological studies that at first appear purely academic but in fact are intimately related to how humans interact with the financial environment we have created.
    <br><br>
    Some concepts were familiar to me, but seeing them through the eyes of a trained psychologist has molded my perspective to allow a deeper understanding of why these concepts are perpetuated in the first place. And while obviously not a panacea to "becoming a successful investor", it has definitely given me insight into my own behavior and how that translates to my investing habits. We are organisms fine tuned for hunting-gathering, and these instincts can run opposite to the healthy habits necessary for investing.
    <br><br>
    I'm not sure that I'll re-read this in the future, but Crosby includes many intriguing references in this book that I may turn to next, and I imagine that I will be reading more of his works.

<h2>
    Another wonderful read by Alan Watts, this is a nice mix of quotes, his commentary, as well as his original elaboration on what the appearance of duality means and the many ways we can relate to this (non)duality. As always his commentary is very satisfying, Watts presents these ideas in a way that is both fascinatingly clear and consistently entertaining. Some of the excerpts he included in the book were confusing at times, such as the quotes from Hindu or Buddhist texts, but he goes on to explain the significance found in each passage.
    <br><br>
    Most of my exposure to Alan Watts has been through his recorded audio lectures, which are fantastic in their own right, but it's very rewarding to read more of his written texts. He's definitely one of my favorite historical figures, as he is able to talk eloquently about something that is typically considered mystical and esoteric all without creating the impression that this is something hidden and secluded away from the "everyday experience". I do believe the focus of his works are some of the most important lessons we can learn in life, and even though he doesn't have a monopoly on expressing these lessons he does so in a very unique and irreplaceable fashion.

<h2>
    Absolutely beautiful. Even with its impressive wordcount I read through this series very quickly, and that alone could stand as the testament to my enjoyment. I was introduced to this series during a time where sci-fi was my main focus, and sci-fi definitely holds a special place in my heart, but even still this fantasy series satisfied most if not all of my cravings with fiction. The escalation in this edition was fantastic and incredibly epic. There are so many larger things happening in the Cosmere, clearly, but we have seen a lot happen on Roshar. 
    <br><br>
    The characters in this series are still some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, partly due to the lovely dialogue, and partly due to the intricate world that's been revealed. I very much look forward to the next edition of The Stormlight Archives, whenever that is finished in due time. I'm tempted to start reading some of his other works, especially the ones that take place in the same Cosmere universe, but I should probably finish some of the other books I've neglected before doing so. I will conclude by saying "Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."

<h2>
    This was good, not great. The setting is interesting as it focuses on the ability to interact with reality from higher dimensions, and the story focuses on the danger that this increasing power leads to. It was hard to form close relationships with the characters as they're not given a ton of detail, the writing is quick and direct, but not terrible. Some of the character development felt rushed, but it's a short book trying to cover a large timeframe so that's no surprise. There were some twists but nothing mindbending. There were definitely some good nuggets in this, but I don't feel greatly compelled to read more Exurb1a anytime soon.

<h2>
    Greg Egan consistently delivers high quality science fiction, especially if you're looking for something steeped in detailed concepts and exotic possibilities. This work brings alien life to the furthest edges of spacetime, and the exploration of such life is very compelling and mysterious. The motivations are plain; the universe is unstable and life desires to exist, but ultimately no bounds can be placed on the lifeform that chooses to find a way over the coming obstacle. At this point I've read a decent amount of Greg Egan, and I love his hard sci-fi talents, but I think I need to see if there are other authors creating in a similar style. Even still, I will most likely return to reading Egan.

<h2>
    Going into this I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I have enjoyed Liu's <a href="#three-body">previous writing</a> and had high hopes for this, and honestly I was a bit disappointed, but I think that's only because I was so impressed by his more elaborate sci-fi works. I'm not saying it's at all bad, I think the story's creativity is very rewarding and the plot structure is believable and entertaining. The size of this story is small, but it was a fitting length for what needed to be said. If you go into this expecting a lighthearted but fun read instead of something that will be intricately detailed and pushing the edges of thought then I believe most would find it an enjoyable journey.

    I don't think this is a book I could compare with others, it has a unique flavor all of its own. The combination of the time period and the author's perspective of the story's characters creates a very interesting sense of coming across a miracle in nature all while preserving an air of mystery around that miracle. I very much enjoyed slowly understanding Larry more and more. The other characters were at best a background to contrast with Larry's journey. We don't see much of Larry's journey because of his own independent temperament, but even still Somerset creates a very detailed report of how he interprets Larry's inner life. My enjoyment of the story largely stemmed from the fact that I could very much relate to Larry's quest and quirks. I don't think I will reread this, but it does leave me wondering if there exists any of Larry's creations out there somewhere.
