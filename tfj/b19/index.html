<h2>
    I regard books as akin to time travel. An author spends their entire life forming a unique perspective and then distilling this perspective into the books they create. These books preserve their life's knowledge through time, where this knowledge can inform the new perspectives of younger generations. When I finish a book, I want it to stay with me in mind and heart as it shaped a piece of my being. These reviews allow me to easily recall when I finished a book and my brief opinion of it.

<summary><h1>1: Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari</h1></summary>

<a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/" class="booklink"><img src="images/1.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This was one of the most "historical" books I have read in a while. It starts off from the very beginning of mankind, and attempts to work its way up from pre-history all the way into the coming modern ages. Although the future (and many modern innovations) aren't entirely covered, I felt it did a good job at connecting the important historical dots. I recommend this read if you want a refresher on your species' history.

<summary><h1>2: Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Robert M. Pirsig</h1></summary>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance" class="booklink"><img src="images/2.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    What a book. I finished reading it five minutes ago, so I'm still reeling. Trying to unpack it all I suppose. It begins with a simple enough journey on a touring-motorcycle with Robert and his son Chris. It's very raw, real and relatable, but this is only an introduction. The full force of the backstory soon unravels and we slowly learn what's at stake. The philosophical questioning is complimented by the progress they make on their vacation, and eventually you realize that there was never a separation between the philosophy and the journey at all. Though some parts require a little background knowledge of philosophy, I would recommend this book to anyone.

<summary><h1>3: Life 3.0 - Max Tegmark</h1></summary>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_3.0" class="booklink"><img src="images/3.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    Professor at MIT, Max Tegmark peers into the future to give us a hint at what is to come. Filled with uncertainty and guesswork, this was an extensive warning of the barriers humanity will meet when encountering extended intelligence (or artificial intelligence). This book is very well rounded, as it becomes a necessity to discuss physics and philosophy in the approach to properly understanding AI. I thought this book compared well to Nick Bostrom's 'Superintelligence', with Life 3.0 being a little bit less technical. Overall I thought it was a great reminder of the future shock that AI will bring. It may not occur in my lifetime, but regardless we need to think about the coming intelligence explosion like it's on our doorstep.

<h2>
    This was a smaller pocketbook, mainly filled with quotes, but it also has the occasional short story focused on Eastern wisdom. Impermanence and change, contentment, beauty and truth, this is a book that I will bring with me on many journeys, as it is just small enough to carry but filled to the brim with grounding meditations.

<summary><h1>5: The Age of Analysis - Morton White</h1></summary>
<p>2-11-19</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3105842-age-of-analysis" class="booklink"><img src="images/5.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    This entry in The Mentor Philosophers series analyzes 20th century philosophers with included commentary from a Harvard Professor of Philosophy, Morton White. Each chapter focuses on a specific philosopher, with Morton White giving an introduction of the philosopher's background and influence. The chapter then concludes with selected writing from the philosopher's popular works. I found this style did well at giving each philosopher enough room to argue their point while also providing excellent contrast between the fellow philosopher's of that era. I was very pleased with the balance of Morton White's commentary and the potency of the philosophers' first-hand accounts. I will definitely be looking into the other books in this series.
    <br><br>
    The next time I read through this book I want to take much more detailed notes, with an emphasis on orienting how the vastly different philosophers influenced each other's works.

<summary><h1>6: Philosophy: 100 Essential Thinkers - Philip Stokes</h1></summary>

<h2>
    Although this book doesn't go too deep into each philosopher's thinking, it was just enough to show the reader the many comparisons across time. This book is a great way to find new philosophers to study, if one is unfamiliar with the big names. The structure of the book also allows one to use it as reference material, searching up a specific philosopher or time-period to refresh the memory.

<h2>
    Each chapter of this book is a separate essay covering a new topic than the rest, which results in a flow of novelty while remaining true to the themes of mathematics, philosophy and history. This formatting makes me think I will return to it often whenever I want to revisit one of the many interesting essays. Jim Holt's writing is very informative and humorous and I will definitely be looking into his other works.

<h2>
    Although this piece is rather short and full of typos, it's not meant to be studied and re-visited, but put into action. It is a connection to the infinite that puts creativity in a light of chaotic perfection. It is a call to action.

<summary><h1>9: The 13½ Lives of Captain Bluebear - Walter Moers</h1></summary>

<h2>
    One of the most unique pieces of fiction I've read, this is an autobiographical tale of Bluebear and his many adventures across Zamonia. Walter's creative world is chock-full of surprising characters with extensive motives and they're all entangled from the beginning to the end. It can be a long read, but I think the exposure to this quirky text was worth it.

<h2>
    This was some of my first "lengthy" exposure to Camus and I'm incredibly impressed by his writing. I'm excited to discover his other works, and see how they relate with this collection. A lot of my experience with his philosophical inquiry was making connections to other schools of thought, and the similar conclusions being made. This is definitely going to be another one I hope to re-read.

<summary><h1>11: HOW TO READ NATURE - Tristan Gooley</h1></summary>
<p>4-20-19</p>

<h2>
    One of the biggest first impressions I got from this book was the conscious nod to philosophy and its prevalence in his adventure of awareness. Tristan Gooley has learned how to exist in habitats with a trained perspective that sees connection and harmony. He demonstrates how truth and the quest of knowledge can reveal structures of reality that bring you closer to understanding where you fit in with your environment. With Stoic example, he emphasizes the necessity of conflict, and teaches how we can learn from it in our observations. I was very impressed, it satisfied what I was expecting from this type of book while also presenting a more profound analysis of reality.

<h2>
    I first discovered Russell Brand through his comedic routines and then through his podcast, Under the Skin. He's a very witty and lively personality with a clear gift for expressing himself through love and humor. This book is a monologue of his spiritual journey in meeting and learning from his mentors, and how he's been a mentor in his own life. It's less "How to" and more "autobiography", but the writing itself was certainly not bad and it was an enjoyable little read.

<h2>
    I took my time getting through this book, I believe it was started in 2018, so it's been a slow trek through what is a topography of the obstacles in the common human mind. Each chapter covers one bias or fallacy in reasoning with accompanying examples, humorous observations and ways to mitigate the error. I thought it was easily grasped and could be a beneficial read to nearly everyone. This isn't one I will quickly return to for re-reading, but I do believe the content in this book is worth remaining aware of. Already have there been times when I have identified real-life examples of what is warned of extensively in The Art of Thinking Clearly.

<h2>
    I consumed this as an audio book and I enjoyed it. It's an illustration of the importance of taking risks and all the philosophical reasonings behind having "skin in the game". I don't believe this is one that I will re-read, at least not for several years.

<h2>
    Audiobook. I consumed this rather quickly, and not once did I think "when is this going to end", I just wanted more. Most people give no attention or thought to the common zombies in our environments, they may be creeped out or even afraid of doing so. Matt Simon takes the road less traveled in this thrilling tale through all the most invasive and gut-wrenching parasites known to thrive on zombiefication. Even if you never have to deal with a zombie in your lifetime, this book illustrates how all organisms are deeply connected.

<h2>
    This is definitely not my first encounter with Alan Watt's ideas, but it's my first time reading through The Book in entirety. It's a very therapeutic experience, reminding the Self that things are not as serious as they may appear, sincere and playful, yes, but perhaps not the entire story. The central theme is the idea that, the sensation of the Self being separate from the environment is akin to the illusion that the world is flat: it may seem like that from our perspective but investigations into reality clearly dispel the notion. I will surely pick this delightful read up again.

<h2>
    A quirky tale that is both realistic and outlandish, it approaches through the perspective of an ordinary worker in a Supermarket, but it quickly demonstrates how even the ordinary has a deeper reality to it. It was very memorable, though I don't know if I would re-read it soon, and I wasn't very surprised by the twists and turns but it was still an enjoyable read.

<h2>
    This took me a while to read. Many of the sections I had to go back and re-read, either out of pure enjoyment or plain confusion. I can't pretend to understand everything in this Magnum Opus, but I'm not sure Nietzsche intended for the entirety to be comprehensible. The writing is grandiose, almost like a dramatic play or musical, and the philosophy he preaches comes in parable and metaphor. I very much enjoyed reading it, and will probably peruse through the pages once again.

<h2>
    I really love this collection of writings. They're very variable in size and style of content, a lot of parts I felt I was reading poetry instead of philosophy or religious discussion. But that may just be the effect of trying to write about something ineffable. I'm very glad I have this as a part of my collection and I look forward to adding more Alan Watts to my library.

<h2>
    This was a fantastic experience. It is a true journey, filled with wisdom and beauty. It was one of those books where once I started reading I couldn't really stop. There are wonderful illustrations that tie the whole thing together. There are a few typos here and there but at the same time, it's poetry, so I can't REALLY say that they're typos.

<h2>
    This is a comprehensive and detailed historical account of energy usage and its affects. Smil walks us through our relationship with energy by providing specific metrics and great comparative examples. It seems to present information with as little bias as possible, while still confronting the barriers and advantages to the various forms of energy we have encountered. I don't see myself re-reading this for some time, but I thought it did a good job at demonstrating the importance of thinking in terms of energy flows.

<h2>
    This is a great little book. It's tiny enough to carry around (pocket book) and I have brought it with me on several adventures. Great for quick reading. It contains translations for the Tao Te Ching, Chuang-tzu, Huai-nan-tzu, Wen-tzu, Tales of inner meaning, and Sayings of ancestor Lu. If you're unfamiliar with taoist or zen philosophy you could even regard it as a poetry book. It reaches those poetic and lofty heights that one must access to even begin an attempt at describing Tao. I'm very glad this is in my collection and I think it will be a companion to me for quite some time.

<h2>
    This is a nice little science appetizer for those who are interested in the cosmos. It doesn't go in-depth with any of the concepts that it shares, but that's the point. It's more like a collection of possible routes of exploration. It does a good job at demonstrating how little we really know about our position in this universe, and it also takes the time to sneak in a little history lesson now and then. It was released in 2017 so it's not too outdated, which can be an important thing to consider when reviewing the frontier sciences. I really appreciated the ending that discussed the "cosmic perspective", and how an understanding of the greater picture can change our interaction with the scale of reality we are used to. I won't be re-reading this anytime soon, but that's because I would like to move onto more detailed discussions of astrophysics.

<h2>
    I thought this was a good mixture of philosophy, history, neuroscience, and guided meditation. I love learning about the brain, so the presentation of neuroscience with a focus on the enlightened state was very interesting. The author seems to be very informed on the subject and he does his best to explain the important pieces to a layman while staying on topic. Personally I skipped over the guided meditation, which doesn't mean they aren't useful, but I just prefer silent meditation. I can see a time when these guided meditations would be very appreciated. I'm going to recommend this book to anyone interested in self-exploration.

<h2>
    I thought this was an extensive, well-written exploration of the prominent philosophers throughout history. Of course not everyone can be included, but those that are included are covered with an evident passion and due diligence. There are lots of quotes and excerpts from the specific philosophers, which I enjoyed, along with Will's commentary. I'm interested to see how it compares with Russel's History of Western Philosophy, which I have read chapters of but not in entirety. Ultimately I'm very glad to have come across this tomb of history and thought.
