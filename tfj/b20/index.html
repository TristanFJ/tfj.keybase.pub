    I regard books as akin to time travel. An author spends their entire life forming a unique perspective and then distilling this perspective into the books they create. These books preserve their life's knowledge through time, where this knowledge can inform the new perspectives of younger generations. When I finish a book, I want it to stay with me in mind and heart as it shaped a piece of my being. These reviews allow me to easily recall when I finished a book and my brief opinion of it.

<summary><h1>26: The Doors of Perception &amp; Heaven and Hell - Aldous Huxley</h1></summary>
<p>1-5-20</p>

<h2>
    I thought that, for something written in 1956, this was an interesting exploration of the relationship between psychedelics and the human mind. This copy included two works that went well together, and you can see the thread of thought continuing in Huxley's mind through the separate works. For something as nebulous as psychedelics (and psychology), Huxley tries to explore the interactions while being as grounded as possible, bringing in examples from art history as well as mental disabilities like schizophrenia. Even approaching the writing with a completely neutral perspective on the content, the writing flows with the same artistry that Huxley is known for. I don't think I'll be rereading this in the near future, as there isn't a lot of technical content that needs to be digested longterm, but I am definitely interested in his many other works.

<h2>
    Shortly after I discovered Dune and decided it was worth exploring, I started noticing references to it almost immediately. People in my social media network started talking about it, some were reading it for the first time. This is typically a good sign for me, and I'm glad that even today people are coming to learn and appreciate Dune. I only read the first novel, which was separated into three "books", but you really do need to read the first three to allow the story to unfold. Something that initially jumped out to me was the amount of philosophical and spiritual textures that are woven throughout the world that Frank Herbert has created. It wasn't something I was expecting but it's always appreciated when a work can touch on something deeper than the constant fast-paced action we are used to seeing almost universally. With that said there is still a good amount of action, with some scenes that are building up momentum through the entire story. Even though finishing it was very satisfying, and it did feel like things were being concluded, I still got the sense that this was only the beginning. It took three books to set up the foundation of the story, and now the true power moves must be made. I do think I will continue reading this series, just not immediately. I need to take a little bit to let the epicness of it all to digest.

<h2>
    I took my time reading this book. I think I got distracted from it about halfway through, but I finally found the time to complete it and was not disappointed. Not only is it interesting from a political and philosophical standpoint, it's something that seems right around Humanity's corner. The struggles of communities living within the domains of larger societies that don't treat them with equal rights. What started as a prison planet can't stay that way when generations of people have made it their home. Sharing gravity wells but refusing to share fairly. Ultimately it comes down to force, who can sustain the force longest, and the intelligence required to direct that force. Even though Mike was never a flesh-and-blood character that we are so used to relating to, I felt a connection to him consistently throughout the story, and it has persisted through the end.

<summary><h1>29: 21 Lessons for the 21st Century - Yuval Noah Harari</h1></summary>

<a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/21-lessons-book/" class="booklink"><img src="images/29.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    The beginning of this book was very much different than the end. The problems that Yuval presumes will arise for humanity aren't anything simple to resolve or even easy to understand. They are wide in scope, and often require a new lens of reality in order to consider. So he does his best in demonstrating the different lenses we could view the future with, and I believe he does a good job.
    <br><br>
    He explains the danger of certainty. He outlines how humanity uses narrative, story, or fiction to shape our interaction with reality. He understands that the solution isn't as simple as writing a book, letting the readers digest it and voila everything is solved. It's a nuanced situation we find ourselves in, and he actually does very well detailing the nuances.
    <br><br>
    The examples he give are easy for a layman to relate to, and they even open territory that the philosopher is so used to navigating. He attempts to unite both spaces, showing that these aren't confined to specific professions, but they concern us all.
    <br><br>
    And he concludes with anecdotal testimony to how he arrived at his position, what has helped him in the present, namely, he goes on to describe how the Self that we autonomously form a narrative for isn't as stable as it seems, and that meditation can open yet another perspective for us to approach reality through. He tries to explain that the mind, or consciousness, is one of the most mysterious phenomena available to us, and exploring it is available to everybody.

<h2>
    This novel starts out with some pretty heighty promises, but through several detours and elaborations the greater story is slowly brought into view. And it's an intricate story, for sure. Even in the beginning, the concepts introduced put me in a captivated state that altered my perspective of the reality I inhabit. As the story progressed, this altered perspective only became more believable, and even more shocking. The ideas presented in the book could be felt to possibly occur in real life as well, right in your back yard. The more impressive miracles are explained in a scientific way so that you feel like it's a real possibility. In the end I feel like this is just the introduction, a lot of setup for a grander story arc, but even this setup was incredibly entertaining. The author has a way of keeping you hooked through and through. I finished the book incredibly fast. It's a science fiction series that I will need to return to, perhaps after I read a bit more of the Dune series.

<summary><h1>31: The Golden Ratio: The Divine Beauty of Mathematics - Gary B. Meisner</h1></summary>
<p>6-11-20</p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35960136-the-golden-ratio" class="booklink"><img src="images/31.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    I think this is the first book I've read about Phi (or, the golden ratio, or 1.618) and it was pretty impressive. I think there's some fairly solid evidence that demonstrates this has been a recurring theme through history, either kept as a secret for the intellectually privileged, or as a forgotten habit that was inherited from an earlier time. I don't know where I stand as to what the golden ratio really is. Maybe it's just a pattern of measurement that we can overlay onto things, like an inch? But then again, if the golden ratio can lend value to things like the construction of plants and organisms, for whatever reason, then it must have some foundation in physical reality. Whatever that means.
    <br><br>
    I thought the book did a good job demonstrating Phi's prevalence throughout life. It didn't do such a good job at exploring possible explanations, but to be fair that's a pretty big job in itself. You have to start addressing things like philosophy of beauty, which he attempts to do in little spurts. Something I would like to explore is how I can employ Phi in my own works. Can I actually use it to predict financial trends? Can I incorporate it into my visual arts to create a sense of balance, unity, and divinity? I don't know. Nevertheless, it's very intriguing. I don't think this will be the last book I read about Phi.

<summary><h1>32: Foundation - Isaac Asimov</h1></summary>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29579.Foundation" class="booklink"><img src="images/32.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    The main premise of the series, that historical patterns could be mathematically charted and extrapolated into the future, is a very interesting foundation for a story, if I dare say so. Much of the 'mathematical extrapolation of history' relies on the participants of history being mostly unaware of the details, which leaves lots of room for twists and turns along the way. It was fun to explore how a civilization could prepare itself for independency, even if said civilization has little material resources, but lots of knowledge and time for preparation.
    <br><br>
    'Foundation' was an investigation of societal balances, an investigation of what truly matters toward the continuation of an ideal. The multi-generational plot has somewhat of an end goal in mind, a hazy idea of what problems will interfere with that end goal, and a lot of drama as you might expect when dealing with large populations. Even though this is set in the distant future, the economic and political instability that I see in my "base reality" makes me think that this could almost be a manual of questions to pose for today. What knowledge is worth preserving? How can we minimize the more chaotic stages of a kyklos cycle? And ultimately, what is to come, and who has predicted the most accurate picture of the coming reality?
    <br><br>
    I will definitely have to continue this story after I revisit a few other sci-fi series that I've been neglecting: Three-Body Problem, Dune.

<h2>
    This is a dialogue between Bill Moyers and the great Joseph Campbell, and while I didn't always love the questions that Moyers proposed, he did a good job at covering ground that is pertinent to the material at hand. By this I mean that, the topics being discussed aren't exactly clear as daylight, and so further elaboration can be required to really dig deep into the root of the matter. Moyers served well as this advocate for elaboration, and even if Campbell sometimes repeats a previously stated message, it's in good nature, and these lessons do deserve repetition. If you're totally unfamiliar with Campbell's work but you're a lover of story, philosophy, history, or the human experience of life, then Campbell has some beautiful insight to share with you. Campbell's experience seems to have no limitations in regards to culture, he freely draws from whatever is inspiring. This habit of drawing wisdom from where-ever it shows itself results in a well-rounded perspective that Campbell is more than happy to share. I related quite heavily with what Campbell has to say. I think the next book that I read by Campbell will be The Hero With a Thousand Faces.

<h2>
    First of all, this is one of the most graphic books I've read, both of a violent and sexual nature, but the sheer intensity that the author employs isn't without reason. It's exactly what I think would be the natural occurrence if the book's story was to unfold. It wasn't all pleasant, and much of it was over the top, but it was believable according to the narrative. With that aside, this book is something that I could completely believe. Written in 1994, it stands true to the possibilities that we have ahead of us. And it may seem crazy, but it might even be unfolding this very moment. Even if you are in total disbelief of the novel's extremity, I felt that it was pertinent commentary on the state of technology in relation to man. Are we in charge of technology? Did we ever have a choice as to technology's outcome? Can technology be regulated to maximize its goodness, or will there always be both good and bad outcomes? While a small and quick read, it was filled to the brim.

<h2>
    This book was another wonderful reminder to Frank Herbert's incredible literary dancing. Frank doesn't pick and choose between "remarkable story" and "impressive prose", but welds both into a coherent world that is incredibly enjoyable every step of the way.
    <br><br>
    If the first book in the series was about raising up the Fremen to their own independence, then this book details the intricacies involved in maintaining that transition, or more specifically, government. For this reason, many will not recognize the same Muad'Dib as the first book portrayed, but I thought this was a very pertinent side to Paul that we are shown. Being an Emperor comes with certain costs to personality and conduct. At the same time, Paul is approaching the very event that he has made such desperation to avoid. It was an impressive story arc, another solid development in the world of Dune.

<h2>
    This is such a good series. The book has a very strong sense of unity. It all ties together very neatly, and it's incredibly satisfying to watch all the pieces come together. This is also a sci-fi series that I can easily find believable. The concepts are definitely beyond the scope of present technology, but you can follow the fundamental logic without losing your grip on the story.
    <br><br>
    Filled with action, suspense, love, mystery, and just plain beautiful writing. And there's still two more book for me to read, one written by Liu Cixin and another written as fanfic that was then endorsed by Liu.
    <br><br>
    The dark forest extrapolation, or the analysis of cosmic sociology, is very heavy. I don't want to speak too much on it as it's somewhat of a spoiler, but I found it chilling. It makes sense, to me. So maybe instead of trying to go to Mars, and instead of beaming signals and probes into space, maybe we should be building a cloak to hide Earth, and fix this place up for the long run. While staying as quiet as possible.

<h2>
    This was some of the best sci-fi I've ever read. I don't know if everyone would call it "hard sci-fi", but I think the author tried to be as realistic as possible. Even with the fantastical ideas of pushing the limits of physics and trying to reverse-engineer the vastly diverse species in the cosmos, he makes it very believable and easy to follow along, all while blowing my mind several times with each book.
    <br><br>
    I think this series reinstated my love for science fiction. It's important to realize that a lot of these concepts are right around the corner for Humanity. I don't think these "fictional" possibilities are things we can put off, I think they involve society on every level. Even if we don't come close to approaching space travel, or trying to protect our planet from the greater cosmos, our children at least will have to start tackling these questions. And I think sci-fi is a good starting point to expand our perspective of what exactly might be achievable.
    <br><br>
    Ultimately this was a very enjoyable series. It can be a bit long at times but I felt it was necessary to fully explain the details. None of it felt like fluff or just trying to hit a word limit, it was all very vital to the story. I would say you can't just read one of these books and end it there, the whole series is a package that I will recommend to anyone who looks up at the stars and wonders.

<h2>
    The version I read contained several short stories that served as a prelude to the finale, 'Oceanic'. Initially the most striking aspect was how diverse the settings and storylines were. Greg Egan's range of creation in sci-fi seems intergalactic in scale, but he does tend to stick to hard scientific concepts which require a little bit of background understanding.
    <br><br>
    Oceanic is a suspenseful short that details the long journey of coming to terms with certain harsh facts about reality. It's presented in the same hard sci-fi universe, but in this short the advanced setting is just a foundation to express deeper questions.
    <br><br>
    This is an author that addresses a wide range of sensitive topics, mostly of a philosophical bend. That may not be for everyone but in my case I found the topics to be very pertinent to our own age. I will absolutely be reading more Egan.

<h2>
    This was a very short collection of essays, but the brevity didn't detract from the writing at all. You don't learn about fine details of any specific historical events, but Durant paints a picture of what he sees as the largest over-arching patterns throughout Human time. And due to the scale of his goal - which is more concerned with 'history as a whole' than anything - he mentions the Philosopher quite a lot. By that I mean it's clear that Durant has a philosophical-bent, and he appreciates the role of philosophy throughout Human development, and he's careful to demonstrate that side of history for us. This doesn't mean that this is a book for or about philosophers, just that Durant finds it necessary to include that archetype (which I appreciated).
    <br><br>
    I thought the writing was splendid. Even with something like History, which many people can find dull, Durant's writing is so lively and clever that it compels you to keep reading. Beyond the writing, the substance of the thing was satisfying. I think it helps to know a little history when reading this, as it feels more like a refresher than an introducer. It reminds you of the great journey that took us to where we are now, and of course, the great journey ahead of us.

<h2>
    Very short, but worth it. While trying to speak of zen is like biting your teeth, this book does so in a roundabout and entertaining way by speaking of the art of archery. A few years ago, I was practicing the sport of precision marksmanship (I attained the badge of "expert marksman" and then stopped), and so I found this book very relatable. The marksman fundamentally aims at himself. However, I have a feeling that this book would resonate to even someone without any training in marksmanship, archery, or the like. I highly recommend it, it's a beautiful experience.

<h2>
    This wasn't something I would normally read with enthusiasm, but I've been wanting to know a bit more history, for one, and also, it was included in the Harvard Universal Classics, so here we are. I don't regret reading it. Not all of it was thrilling, but it was a very interesting insight into a man that I otherwise would only hear bits and pieces of, or rather, the prominent reasons for his fame.
    <br><br>
    Ben Franklin was clearly a generalist. He let his interests guide him, and they brought him many places. If anything, I believe that Franklin's life was a testament to self-discovery, as well as the self-education that accompanies such a process. It's really quite shocking just how many things he did for his local community, and then gradually the world at large. I can understand why this would be the first to the Harvard Universal Classics, as a role model such as Benjamin Franklin would be hard to steer you wrong.

<h2>
    Once again the variety that Egan deploys is incredible. He does have a preference for sci-fi, but I think I'm beginning to see that he isn't in love with the sci-fi itself, but only that the sci-fi is what is required for him to drive home his point. He has these philosophical questions that can't be put in a simple question, but must be lived, through the perspective of a character, to explore the question in finality. And following the question to its depth usually has a profound, lingering taste to it. As I've said before, Egan might put some people off, and I can understand why, but I very much enjoy his works.

<h2>
    I had never read this author's writing before, but I was familiar with his YouTube channel. I really liked this book. Composed of multiple sci-fi shorts, the diverse works carry the theme of the philosophical questions of mind, and what becomes of the Universe, or even the galactic empire as we know it when we conquer The Fifth Science. This seems like a book that was written for its age, where we are already dealing with artificial intelligences that are convincing, productive, or just plain silly. We don't yet consider these artificial intelligences (or "arties" in the book) as sentient, but even the layman has to eventually ask the question: at what point will science transform matter into something radically new and alive?
    <br><br>
    I enjoyed the writing. The narration was slightly casual at times, and he likes to try and get a chuckle, but most of it was very set on creating a world for you to experience and I think he succeeded. There are twists and turns, revelations, soft moments, and cliff hangers. But I think, most importantly, these aren't just lofty ideals that might someday come true. I believe these are real questions that we as a society will have to face, eventually, maybe in a thousand years, maybe in a hundred. And for that reason alone I think books like these are worth the time, just so that we can take a glimpse into a possible future, see how it makes us feel, consider it, and maybe even create lasting changes.

<h2>
    This was a great read and I think it was the perfect size. It was just long enough to bring in a lot of examples, and just short enough to keep my attention on the many different ways that generalists can thrive. This isn't a book that tries to say that specialization is a waste, but it demonstrates that we need both sides of the spectrum. Experimentation and innovation doesn't operate with an end goal in mind, it has to be a little inefficient in some areas to find the undiscovered efficiency that can be integrated from diverse fields that would otherwise be thought of as separate.
    <br><br>
    Ultimately I think the underlying message of this book is to follow your curiosity. We can't know everything in advance that will be profitable or valuable to our lives, and lessons learned in one specialty can be applied to other new ventures. And the other beautiful message is that you're not behind, if you feel a desire to explore something new then don't feel too afraid to "fall behind the crowd", it might just turn into a new magical combination.

<h2>
    Another awesome collection by Egan. The large majority of the stories I read by Egan are satisfying the exact desire I have for sci-fi, which is something like being both weird and believable, pushing the edges of reality while still trying to exist within a logical framework. When the rules are broken they are done so in a way that feels creative and thrilling, and not at all like cheating.
    <br><br>
    Egan's characters aren't the best I've ever encountered, but they haven't distracted me from the stories. The arcs that the characters take are inseparable from the larger scientific narrative that he builds, and the diversity of his writing is just as enjoyable as always. This collection follows the same "hard sci-fi" pattern, where knowing some background knowledge of nerdy stuff can be a tremendous aid to understanding and inhabiting the worlds that Egan constructs, but I wouldn't say you need to be a rocket scientist to enjoy his works.

<h2>
    I honestly didn't love this one. I wouldn't say it was bad; it was definitely creative, not something I've imagined in a world, but it wasn't groundbreaking or mindblowing. The most prominent feature of the book was the scientific method, and the trials that are required of investigating a totally foreign process. In a way it felt like social commentary, with everyone pointing fingers at everyone else, and only a few actually trying to make progress. In the end I didn't feel very satisfied, things were resolved in a way but I wasn't left as much information about the Dispersion as I would've hoped.
    <br><br>
    It was short so I didn't lose much time by reading it, but it's not one that I think I would return to. Worth a couple bucks and a rainy afternoon if you're the type who likes investigative science and weird settings.

<summary><h1>47: John Woolman's Autobiography</h1></summary>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/622117.The_Harvard_Classics_Autobiography_of_Benjamin_Franklin_Journal_of_John_Woolman_Fruits_of_Solitude?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=tKtHEZobBE&rank=1" class="booklink"><img src="images/47.jpg" width="75" title="link to book" alt="image link not found"></a>
<h2>
    I can only recommend this read to those interested in Quakers or Abolitionist-history. Most of the book's contents are descriptions of his travels, usually to visit other Quakers, and it becomes very repetitive. He visits this town, sees these people, has a meeting where he is inspired by the Divine Love and then moves on. This seems to be the majority of the book, but it's not the entirety. There are bits and pieces that I found of value; it is certainly interesting to see from the perspective of a Quaker in the 1700's. But near the end I was definitely more excited to finish and move on than reading the next chapter.
    <br><br>
    I can't blame him for his writing as he begins the book by saying he wishes to write something as a testament to his God, and he does so. Many times through his travels he talks about how weak he is, how sad he becomes from seeing slaves and the like, and how God transformed his mind and gave him peace. He also talks about the blessing of frugality, meekness, and the temptations of wealth, which I appreciated as that's a side of Christianity that we don't really see these days.
    <br><br>
    There was one part where he describes an angel coming to him at night, in the form of a sphere of light, and he only writes a sentence or two about it. I wish he talked more about that, it felt strange to mention such an experience and then move on without very much commentary. I don't think I will revisit this anytime soon.

<h2>
    This was my favorite of the other Quaker's writings. Written in Enchiridion-form, Penn tries to squeeze as much wisdom into his journals as he can. I agreed with a lot of it, in parts I gained some insight, and in others I didn't know what he was saying. There is a language barrier between now and the ~1700's. I enjoyed it, it didn't take too much time to read, but I don't think I will re-read it at least for quite some time.

<summary><h1>49: The Apology, and Crito, by Plato</h1></summary>

<h2>
    I'm including both The Apology and Crito as one review because they follow the same events and I finished them on the same day, but I have yet to finish Phaedo. I do really love these writings. It's not the first time I've read them but it's always nice to revisit. In an age like ours, it's quite striking to see someone with a dedication to virtue and reason instead of the passions of the body. Socrates, whether he was real or not, demonstrates that a man with values should hold onto them even to the very end. And it's obviously easier said than done, but there's something moving about hearing of Socrates speak his own testimony for the cause behind his actions. Another aspect I love is his willingness to obey God's commands, if his time has come then he embraces it with a happiness, for he knows he has acted within his own virtues. He lives with a love of fate.
    <br><br>
    This isn't something that only philosophers should read, I definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone. They're not very long or hard to understand, so give it a shot.

<h2>
    This was a really cool story. At first it starts out simple enough, the progression of computer science enabling all the wonderful and strange things that it does, but then the view pans out and we are left staring at something so vast that it's hard to wrap your head around. I'll once again try to avoid anything too detailed for the sake of those who want to read it, but the hard sci-fi holds true to Egan's reputation. Fantastical and scientific while attempting to be grounded in the realm of plausibility, but simultaneously so outlandish that it leaves you reeling.
    <br><br>
    There are many philosophical questions in this, but Egan would rather watch them dance together in the uncertain and unfolding future than try to face them head on and reduce them to certainties. If you're interested in consciousness, or computer science, or exotic ideas of maths, I can highly recommend this, and even if you're not I would say give it a shot. This was a very fun, mind-bending read.

<h2>
    This was an interesting development in the story. It was kind of short, but entertaining through and through. There was a big twist, which is always fun, even if I did have suspicions of it from the beginning. This book sort of felt like a bridge between the first book and the third, like it's setting the stage for the next in line while also bringing the reader up to speed on the happenings in the first. I'm excited to read the third in this series, but I also want to read more Dune.

<h2>
    I think Phaedo is less about what is being discussed and more about how it's being discussed. This is the iconic Socrates-on-his-death-bed, and so there are discussions about the soul and other things that one might wish to talk about as they approach death, though Socrates doesn't choose these topics out of his own concern but for the concern of his friends. One of the most striking aspects is how fearless Socrates was said to be in the face of death. His reasoning was that he spent a life well lived, in pursuit of virtue instead of wealth and therefore he was ready for death. He accepted his fate with love, with a belief that for him to obey God's will is the highest of goals. It's not a very long read and I definitely recommend it.

<h2>
    Egan did another great job with this book, however I can't recommend it to everyone. The storyline heavily features things like neural implants and quantum mechanics which necessarily raise the question of Free Will along the entire way. If those things even slightly interest you then I highly recommend it. It was a great journey, filled with mystery, suspense, and the feeling of awe that Egan so reliably delivers.

<summary><h1>54: The Golden Sayings of Epictetus</h1></summary>

<h2>
    Stoicism was one of the first schools of philosophy that I started exploring so it's always enjoyable for me to revisit the great Stoics. I haven't read much Epictetus and I enjoyed it, however at times the translation was a bit confusing, and I couldn't agree with everything Epictetus says. At one point he talks about how we should live without excess luxury, but then he says that having servants (read, slaves) attend to our house or dinner parties isn't luxurious. I understand that having a few slaves was just part of the age and culture, but for a Philosopher who talks a lot about introspection and the importance of frugality it just seems strange that he would have accepted slaves (or even paid servants for that matter) as frugal, part of Nature's Plan, instead of a bit over the top. Maybe he only needed them in his older age?
    <br><br>
    Ultimately I'm glad I read this. He mentions God often in his discussions, and if this would put anyone off I would suggest mentally replacing God with "All that is". He doesn't try to fit God within a specific doctrine or set of rules and traditions, instead he approaches God as one would approach a love of Fate, or Amor Fati. The idea of Stoicism is that the human concerns himself with what is in his control (which is often very little) and that God, or Fate, or what is outside of our control is ultimately for the best, and we should love the Will of God. He also mixes this idea of God with Nature, however he doesn't expand a lot upon what is Nature and what isn't.

<h2>
    This felt pretty chaotic. There were certainly some interesting parts, as well as some boring parts, but overall it's not too bad considering the year it was written (1972). You'll want some interest in the brain to read this book, as well as a tiny understanding of computers to follow the theme. The author thinks of the brain as a computer, which is a generally agreeable perspective but he doesn't go too deep into the computer science aspect of things besides utilizing some computer-science-esque terminology.
    <br><br>
    He kind of jumped around, there wasn't strong cohesion to the book's progression. This isn't a deal-breaker for me, it was just a bit jarring at times. The most interesting portion of this book for me was his reporting on psychoanalysis of patients who were in isolation / float chambers, deprived of sensation and then given LSD. He reports some interesting observations, and tries to remain objective and observant, but in the end he chalks up the LSD-braincomputer-interaction as basically LSD introduces noise into the computer system and that's the cause of the LSD experiences. This might be a partial explanation but I didn't think it was much of a conclusion. At least he attempted an observation I suppose. It was short so I don't regret reading it.

<h2>
    This was a fun read, very eerie. I had watched the movie before reading this, so it was a little spoiled but still enjoyable. Something I like about books like these are that it makes you appreciate what we have. The world may be a little topsy-turvy, but it's not 'alien invasion' level chaos, which we don't often consider. There's nothing to say that we won't ever be invaded by aliens; maybe not Martians, granted, but the book is still a creepy reminder to appreciate our uncontested Earth soil.
    <br><br>
    Another aspect I appreciated was how little action there was. It was more suspenseful than action. It's not exactly what you could call a war, the humans have very little impact against the Martians, which I think added to the realism. And to avoid spoilers that's all I'll say. I can see why H.G. Wells is one of the classic sci-fi authors.

<h2>
    Pretty good story. This was another classic that I knew about before actually reading it so the narrative was slightly spoiled but still an enjoyable read. The story has less to do with the paradoxes of time travel, which a lot of creators seem to jump on whenever time travel comes up, but instead Wells takes this opportunity to peer into the possibilities of the developmental progression of society and humanity as a species. This was largely believable, Wells seems pretty thorough in trying to impart a level of realism.
    <br><br>
    It was clearly influenced by the sociological discussions of his time (the worker versus the owner) but I didn't think it was so heavy that it ruined anything. In the end, the time machine was more of a means to discussing the distant-future sociology instead of the concept of time travel itself, which was fine and good but still I think an important distinction.

    I loved this book. It's a topic that I've been pondering for over four years now, and it was really exciting to find something so relatable. This book is pretty extensive, it has plenty of examples and data to back up the presented arguments. While in a sense it only scratched the surface, it's also one of the most thorough works I've found on the subject. I highly recommend it if you're interested in the phenomena of order, information, or economics.

<h2>
    This was a pretty fun read. Parts of it were hard to understand. Not scientifically confusing, just kind of vague or written strangely. But maybe that's just me. I'm not saying it was written poorly, just that portions left me a little confused. Ultimately it's a fun story. This is a book that I would recommend to people who are wanting to dip their toes into sci-fi, as it's not super steeped in sci-fi but the setting is just futuristic enough to be a nice introduction to the sci-fi style of worldbuilding.

<h2>
    I was surprised by the direction that Wells took this story. Before reading, I had assumed that the majority of the narrative would be a slow, suspenseful investigation into the mystery surrounding the backstory of the invisible man. However most of the backstory of the invisible man was revealed early in the introduction, and in true "Wellsian fashion", the rest of the narrative was focused around the power that being invisible would bring to man, and how the mad scientist archetype could abuse this fantastic power.
    <br><br>
    It was definitely written for its own time. Being invisible isn't something that many would seriously think of as a superpower, especially once you consider the specific circumstances that would be required for that power to be used. There are other, wilder science fiction scenarios that can yield great power, but there's something down-to-earth about an invisible man. What I mean to say is that it's a very human fear to wonder about an invisible evil-doer, but in the end it's not the worst sci-fi disaster that could happen. I do recommend this read, especially if you enjoy the "absolute power corrupts absolutely" narrative.

<h2>
    I'm a big fan of Campbell's work, and this had the same rock-solid quality that he consistently delivers. It was a bit less extensive than the other book I read (The Power of Myth) but it was still well worth the read. This book was more focused on Christianity, which I could appreciate as I was raised Methodist, and though I no longer self-identify with that label I still appreciate the teachings of Jesus Christ, even if I don't fully agree with the modern interpretations.
    <br><br>
    I have a feeling I will be studying Campbell for my entire life, as he seems to be a wellspring of wisdom that is eternally refilling.

<h2>
    This was basic, but not too basic considering it's an introduction. Jung seems to be a very prolific and wide-ranging character, and this was a nice appetizer to his collection of works. I would like to read more Jung, but I'm not exactly sure where to start, possibly the Red Book. I own a paperback version of his 'Synchronicity' which I have so far neglected, but I might just have to buckle down and study it, as synchronicity is definitely an interest of mine. The graphics in this book didn't always contribute to understanding the content but it incorporated a nice balance throughout.

<h2>
    I'm coming to understand that words fall short of the most fundamental truths in life. Even in spite of this we still attempt to share our understandings with others, and the Gita is another timeless expression of that. A good portion of this book deals with "surface level material", but there are definitely nuggets of truth if you are sincere about listening to them. I think I will need to reread this, or find different translations to study.

<h2>
    This was one of those books that saddened me as I reached the end. Even knowing all things come to pass, I wanted this to go on and on, however I think what I truly desire is just to have met Alan Watts in person. I recommend this read to anyone interested in Alan Watts "the person", as while he does talk about his philosophies (as they are manifestations of his life), they are not the sole focus of the book. In true Watts' fashion, he speaks a lot about the people that he loved throughout his life, as you cannot have an idea of Self without the Other. I think what's truly special about this book is that it has no specifically intended message. His other works seem to focus on a topic that he tries to convey to the reader, while in this autobiography he is given the space (nothingness) required to truly play with whatever he desired in that moment.
    <br><br>
    PS: I just realized this is the 64th entry in my book-reviews, which reminds me of the 64 trigrams of the I Ching. A satisfying coincidence, or maybe more, I will let you decide.
